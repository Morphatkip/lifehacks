Insistence on pursuing the same activities differently has been a cause for failure. The theory of the business advocates for constant revision of the objectives. To put it simply, once a firm achieves its strategic objectives, it should consider doing something new rather than relaxing and waiting for returns. There is a price to pay but it is nothing compared to the risks of remaining rigid. Initially, Intel dealt in memory chips. The invention was groundbreaking and gave the company enormous profits. However, soon enough new firms, most of them Japanese, began producing memory chips that were cheaper and improved. The management of Intel sat back thinking they could innovate their way out of the challenge. The resultant nosedive in revenue was historic and made the managers ask the question that mattered: what to do rather than how. That marked their shift from memory chips to microprocessors and the price they had to pay was huge as many employees lost their jobs. The move, however, was a revelation as the growth of the computer market strengthened the brand significantly. 3. Case Study: Dollar Shave Club: Disrupting the Competition for One Dollar Dubin showed the highest level of competitive awareness when he launched Dollar Shave Club. Prior to the launch, Gillette ruled the male grooming market and continually produced newer and fancier products to improve its market position. However, like the inkjet printers that had ink cartridges\u2019 prices almost exceeding the printers\u2019 the razors were expensive. Dubin spotted a niche and immediately exploited it, forming the Dollar Shave Club. Dollar Shave Club provided customers with a blade handle and razors followed by replacement razors according to a customer\u2019s subscription. Dollar Shave Club managed to compete with the powerful Gillette and in the end, it made a lot of profits resulting in a take-over by Unilever. The difference in the practices of Gillette and Dollar Shave Club are evident; the former made assumptions about customer preferences while the latter provided the customers with exactly what they ordered. Even though the competition became unfavorable in the end, Gillette had learnt something new. 4. Case Study: Throw Out the Knitting and Stick to Vertical Integration Apple and Tesla are among the most successful companies in the world and among the leading in their industries. The case study cites vertical integration as the reason behind their enormous success. Vertical integration, according to the article, is a strategy companies use to control their suppliers and their distributors so as to increase their power in the market and secure their supplies. When a company moves upwards, it reduces the power of the suppliers while a downward movement reduces the power of the distributors by moving closer to the consumers. It stands on the popular saying, \u201cif you want something done well, do it yourself. Apple applies the strategy effectively by designing its own chips and writing its software and by running its own retail shops. Tesla, on the other hand, makes 80% of its cars and sells directly to consumers, eliminating middlemen. Vertical integration has many benefits that the case study highlights. Some of them include establishing good customer relationships, speeding up the chain of distribution, and simplicity. Furthermore, consumers have more faith dealing with a company directly due to the availability of reliable feedback. 5. Case Study: Inditex\u2019s International Reach Inditex is the largest fashion retailer in the world and continues to soar higher despite the competition from other companies like H ","&"," M Hennes and Mauritz of Sweden. The company sells in every region in the world and continues to grow its markets. Inditex has a great business strategy that has ensured its success. Firstly, the company does not manufacture all the products from a central location for distribution. The logic behind it is that by the time the distribution gets to some regions, the clothes would probably already lost the fashion taste. Secondly, the company takes into consideration the culture of a place and makes matching designs. For instance, Germans prefer sporty clothes while Russians fancy pencil skirts with high heels; that is exactly what they get. Another admirable thing about the company is the lack of advertisement. In place of advertisements, the company updates its website regularly and change the look of the stores from time to time. Advertisements can be slow and with the fast changing trends and fashions, they can be inappropriate for such businesses.\u2003 References Adamkasi. (2020).

Some of the problems are either purely social or economic, while some have economic and social aspects. Some of the prevalent social issues in the United States are hate crimes, drug addiction, and media propaganda. Hate crimes result from other social problems such as sexual orientation, racism, religious differences, and disabilities. Economic issues, on the other hand, are more pronounced and occur both internally and externally. The major internal issue is the continually widening gap between the wealthy and the poor. It is a problem that does not show any likelihood of reducing. An external economic issue facing the United States is the growth of other rising powers such as China, India, Russia, and Brazil. They have successfully managed to reduce the global output of the United States in recent years to a worrying level. Other issues like immigration affect the nation both economically and socially. All the issues mentioned above have proven to be problems worth addressing. While some have solutions, some are only debatable but do not necessarily need solving. For instance, hate crimes are manageable through increasing police patrols and surveillance (even though it has brought congestion in the prisons). On the other hand, a social issue like same-sex marriage is not something solvable. Instead, it has become a topic of discussion through the media and in religious groups.

He immediately began expanding the territory, conquering many places in the process. As a result, he got branded \u201cCharles the Great.\u201d However, his move to help Pope Leo III quell the Romans' rebellion saw him anointed with oil by the pope. Hence, he became both a Germanic king and a Roman Emperor. He incorporated Christianity into his lengthy rule, a move that united the people . One particular trait that made Charlemagne a popular leader was his generosity. He often distributed food aid to the poor both within the empire and beyond to places like Egypt.

Invasions by the Vikings, Magyars, and Muslims contributed to the decline of the kingdom. The High Medieval Age recorded a significant population increase never seen before in the history of Europe.

The peasants, therefore, had to work harder, especially during the harvest seasons. The women had a greater responsibility than men. Apart from raising children, they also worked alongside the men in the fields. Hence, peasant marriages were nothing more than "economic partnerships." The only improvement from the Early Middle Age was in terms of food availability. Food was abundant and nutritious for both the peasants and the lords. Alcohol was also a social problem in this period and accounted for most of the accidental deaths. The peasants used an alcoholic drink made from grains called ale while the affluent class drank wine.

It lacks a precise legislative definition, but there are several acceptable explanations. One popular definition is it is an offensive and unlawful contact unconsented by the victim ("Assault and Battery"). Lord Steyn in R vs. Ireland defines battery as "unlawful application of force by the defendant upon the victim" ("Battery"). The use of force is the actus reus of battery, while the intent is the mental element \u2013 mens rea. From the first definition above, it is worth noting that the defendant does not necessarily have to injure the victim. Furthermore, the force or contact does not have to be direct. For instance, throwing a ball at someone and injuring them on the head with it is a case of battery. However, recently there are revisions to laws in many countries that only convict one of battery if the force causes an injury or if the contact is offensive. In the above example, therefore, if the ball does not cause injury, then it is not a battery offense. On the other hand, if someone touches an opposite gender\'s genitals without consent, it is offensive regardless of whether it causes harm. Hence it becomes a battery offense. Therefore, battery involves either contact or force that is either offensive or harmful or both.'}),(0,We.jsx)("p",{children:'The physical element of battery \u2013 the actus reus \u2013 relates to its definition. The use of force, as mentioned earlier, is the physical element of battery. There are three key words considered: "application," "unlawful," and a controversial "physical force" ("Battery"). The first keyword illuminates that the force applied can either be direct or indirect, as mentioned earlier. The second directs that the defendant should not be legally excusable for using the force in the conducted act. An example of a lawful excuse is when one has to defend themselves or when a parent punishes a child \'reasonably.\' Finally, the concept of physical force describes any unlawful and offensive contact. Even though the term seems to suggest a high degree of force, it covers even the lightest touch as long as it is without approval and not lawfully excusable ("Battery"). In contrast, whereas battery entails unlawful use of force, murder involves unlawful killing. The actus reus for murder is the "unlawful killing" of a "human being" "under the Queen\'s peace" ("The Law of Murder").'}),(0,We.jsxs)("p",{children:[" ","The first keyword separates legal killings, such as doctors having to withdraw care, from unlawful ones. The second allows the defendant's conviction only if the victim was a human being and explains at what point one stops to be a human being.

Conduct refers to the act or sometimes omission to an act. Consequences are the results of the act. Circumstances refer to the situations under which the act becomes a crime. Causation is the validation that the conduct led to the consequence. The physical elements of murder and battery have huge differences. The first difference is in the conduct as it leads to different outcomes or consequences in each. The actus reus of murder can only have one consequence \u2013 killing. On the other hand, the actus reus of battery may or may not have a consequence. For instance, hitting someone with a baseball bat would most likely result in injury as a consequence. However, touching someone\'s genitalia will not have any consequence.

For battery, contact is the primary consideration under this element. There are two things in consideration: hostility or recklessness and unlawfulness. Application of force upon someone amounts to hostile touching and is also unlawful when it is without consent. For instance, pinning someone against the wall is aggressive contact, and when they did not approve it, it is unlawful. However, pinning a lover against the wall regardless of how aggressive the contact is, is not battery because there is mutual consent. The overarching idea when looking at the circumstances surrounding the act is that it must have been voluntary. Actions in self-defense and those in the course of preventing a worse consequence do not amount to battery."]}),(0,We.jsxs)("p",{children:[" ",'Circumstances in actus reus of murder differ from those of battery, mainly because the latter must have a consequence. The first circumstance, therefore, is the presence or absence of an alibi ("What Are the Defences to Murder?"). An absence would place the defendant in the scene of the killing and hence, a suspect. Like battery, murder must result from a voluntary act. Hence, the defendant\'s mental state at the time of the occurrence is subject to review to ensure there was no mental illness. Furthermore, there should be proof that the killing was not prompted by pressure: it was not out of duress, for example, death threats. Finally, the victim must be a human being to qualify it to be a murder. A person only ceases to be a human being when their brain stem stops functioning ("The Law of Murder").

For instance, as someone eats a good meal, their double would instead eat raw meat. The author makes references to the past when the protagonist first met her double and the aftermath. He mirrors the beginning of racial discrimination in the United States. Whites, since the colonial era, saw themselves are superior to blacks. Hence, all privileges, beauty, and status got associated with them (Feagin, no pg.). Blacks, on the other hand, were like the doubles in the movie. Their lives got controlled by whites\u2019 decisions and activities.

Whereas some people are rich and afford to lead lavish lifestyles, some are extremely poor and stuck there despite their efforts. The gap between the rich and the poor widens by the day due to the economy's changes that favor the rich. Hence, those born from poor backgrounds today will most likely end up poor for the rest of their life. Katz & Mark (no pg.) point to poverty being especially prevalent among African Americans. According to them, the discrimination that saw African Americans not getting good industrial jobs in the colonial era. Even though the poor are working hard to lift their living standards, the living standards are also rising. Hence, the poor are stuck in a prison they cannot get out of easily.

The Tethered, just like the poor blacks in society, have bitterness against their counterparts. Hence, once they manage to breach into the world, they kill their counterparts mercilessly.

In a way, he insinuates that the fortunate should not think highly of themselves and fail to help lift the poor. Doubles are symbolic of other people who may have occupied our position and status in society. However, due to the limited resources on their part, they may not have gotten the chance to attain the proper qualifications. Peele reminds the audience about the "Hands Across America\u201d campaign of 1986 through the act of the doubles holding hands. The move meant to raise money to alleviate poverty. It managed to raise over $34 million, but the operation costs consumed more than half the amount. In the end, only about $15 million remained for donations.

It attracts audiences and especially makes them think about the theory of parallel universes that has recently appeared in science and popular culture.

Storytelling, thus, is a prominent theme that introduces other themes in creative ways. The author first hears about the Pi\u2019s experiences from an old man, Francis Adirubasamy. Adirubasamy describes the story to the fictional author as: \u201ca story that would make you believe in God\u201d (Martel, 2009). Being at the onset of the movie, the statement introduces religion as a prominent theme brought about by storytelling. As the movie progresses, Pi gets portrayed as religious, practicing Hinduism, Christianity and Islam (Lee, 2012). Each religion came with its stories and parables and he would not give up any one for another. Furthermore, he believed that science and religion could mutually co-exist unlike the popular belief. To him, it was about \u201cthe better story\u201d to believe in especially at a time of duress and distress. He, therefore, accepts science as a fact giver and religion as a better option for the mind. For instance, science proves the existence of a zebra through a scientific name while religion calls it a creation of God.

However, having had a scientific background of growing up in a zoo coupled with his love for his biology teacher Mr Kumar, he would not give up on science at the expense of religion.

Pi grows up in a zoo and despite his parents\u2019 warning against closeness to animals, he instead comes to consider human beings as greater dangers. Secondly, religious stories have redemptive promises unlike science accounts. The stories give significance to harsh experiences and give hope and encouragement during difficult times.

Furthermore, he cites Pi\u2019s alienation from other human beings and the suffering he endures as a requirement of love (Isaiah 53:3).

This period roughly runs between 2 years and the beginning of puberty. During this period, the brain has cerebral plasticity and hence, language acquisition is natural. Furthermore, language is evenly spread in the brain across both hemispheres. At puberty, the brain hemispheres begin specialising in specific activities and this limits language acquisition. Furthermore, the plasticity disappears and the brain becomes rigid (Lenneberg, 1967). Lenneberg, however, does not rule out the possibility of language acquisition happening past puberty.

There are many practical examples of the same in the population. As a result, in many regions in the world, younger and younger children are getting introduced to language teaching (Hall, 2011). There is extensive research in support of the claim. Hu (2016) notes that there is a critical period where children show an advantage over adults in second language acquisition.

For instance, culture has for a long time shaped the behaviour of the different gender groups. Boys are in most cases more vocal than girls in class but still girls manage to outwit them in language performance. In the United Kingdom, for example, and many other regions in the world, girls are the better performers in language. The cause is often cultural practices and social norms which from an early age encourage girls to develop better social interaction skills and consequently learning strategies (Hall, 2011). The practices pass on through generations and get incited through societal pressures. Women for instance in most societies consider languages an important aspect of future lives and hence, they have better learning strategies than men.

Motivation is key towards achieving short-term and long-term objectives and any decrease would certainly affect performance. It would be important to know whether the learners are motivated and if so, where they derive their motivation from: whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from within an individual and is a result of their interest or passion in doing something. Extrinsic motivation comes from without and could be from the environment, from a desire to achieve a reward or to avoid punishment. If the motivation is intrinsic, the learners would likely have read ahead of the teacher. However, if it is extrinsic, it would mean the students are relying solely on outside motivation to work.

Furthermore, the country disparaged international assessments on the grounds that the key aspects of education are not measurable (Bos and Postlethwaite, 2002). As a result of the alienation from international academic comparisons, the PISA results were not especially kind towards them. German learners scored poorly in many fields compared to other learners from the other participating countries (Waldo, 2009). Furthermore, the difference between the highest and lowest scorers was particularly large in the country. The results made Germany take steps to improve and consequently many educational researchers took an interest in the issue (see: Hentig: 2003; Ertl, 2006; Gruber, 2006; Seiverth, 2007). An almost similar shock hit the United Kingdom after the 2009 results that saw the nation drop from the last rankings.

According to Oates (2017), understanding the specifics of something and its underlying basic assumptions is the key to successful implementation. However, it has the effects of narrowing the objectives, making them more initiative-grounded. However, there is no harm in going that direction as long as it realises positive results. Poor implementation has mostly been cited whenever a system that worked well elsewhere fails in a different place. Implementation is just a minor piece in the puzzle with the main problem being understanding the context and complexity of the system. Furthermore, even narrowing to specific elements of the system can still result in failure where there is no proper understanding of the interaction between the elements.

England is an example of a nation that has suffered such as feat. After a thorough international research review, analysts came up with an initiative to improve academic performance that placed a lot of emphasis on formative assessment. However, trials with the practices in a few places failed to produce the anticipated results, falling way below their expectations (Oates, 2017). Investigations attributed the fall to the influence of certain outside accountability issues often interfering with the teaching process (Ravitch, 2016). Accountability is of prominence when it comes to implementing complex systems (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2013); in the England case, therefore, lack of proper alignment between accountability and the formative assessment resulted in the poor results (Oates, 2017).

They studied the high performing nations and realized that in their settings, the curriculum focusses on fewer items communicates the objectives and expectations very clearly (Schmidt and Prawat, 2006). This decision making concerning what to teach, how to teach and taking necessary steps to communicate the procedures clearly is what the study termed curriculum coherence. According to Oates (2017), a coherent system is one whose national curriculum content, course books, teaching material, pedagogy and assessments are associated and support each other.

This respect and positivity towards teachers influences the learners\u2019 attitudes, significantly affecting their behaviour, motivation, innovation and decision making (Oates, 2017). To maintain the academic dominance, the Finnish education system gets incessantly revised in response to recognised changes in the youth culture (Oates, 2017). This started at the beginning of the 21st century when the standards of the education system were declining gradually due to alleged shifts in the culture of the youth.

What most researchers in the past have failed to consider is the capability of culture to mutate to match a specific system and possibly promote it as in the case of Finland mentioned above.

The models in commonality emphasize that every child has the capacity to learn anything presented to them as long as it is well exhibited and they put an effort into learning it. The revision challenged some ideas of the models such as differentiated instruction and individualised learning that were no longer effective in light of the changing youth culture (Oates, 2017). Furthermore, the national assessments based on levels of education within the systems got loosed and were no longer mandatory.

Hence, crossing international borders exposes education systems to cultures that may or may not favour the arrangements.

To achieve this, authors introduce evil, often in the form of supernatural forces, and combine light and sound to a terrifying effect.

They accompany scary visualizations such as appearances of gigantic figures, disappearance of people, and other things. The overall effect of the devices is that the memories stick to your mind for a long time and can cause insomnia and phobias such as fear of darkness. Furthermore, you will tend to respond more explosively to some things that you were initially less perturbed by.

Some of the significant psychological research concepts include hypotheses, sampling, variables, case studies, and peer review. The hypothesis of research refers to a prediction that is subject to approval or disapproval after an investigation, such as an experiment. The hypothetico-deductive theory applies testing of hypotheses against experiments to investigate something (Haig, 2018). Hypotheses are always subject to support or refute. Those that stand against all criticisms are said to be corroborated. Sampling involves selecting a target population for research. It is important in that it makes work easier with application generalizations on the sample to represent the entire population. Case studies are detailed investigations of an individual, group, or phenomenon. They are very common in psychological research. They are vital for their resourcefulness and high degrees of accuracy and ecological credibility. Finally, peer review refers to the voluntary assessment by an expert in the field of an article written by a researcher. It is essential since it ensures originality and prevents inaccurate figures from getting to the public.

However, even with its limitations, it has maintained its popularity among many scientists. Some of its opposers have recommended complete abandonment of the theory (Glymour, 1980; Rozenboom, 1997). On the contrary, it also has some merits. A few optimists feel that modifications are all the theory requires to yield acceptable results (Sprenger, 2011).

The angular speed of a rotating electron where the stationery orbit can be located is a numerical multiple of the reduced Planck constant. m_e vr=n\u210f The value of n takes an integer value which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 The number n is termed as the principal quantum number. The value of \u210f is calculates as \u210f=h/2\u03c0 The least possible value of n is one. The Bohr radius which is the smallest radius of an atom obtained using the value of n (n =1) is 0.0529 nm. Once an electron is in the Bohr radius there is no other closer orbit that is more close to the nucleus. This postulation enables Bohr to calculate the hydrogen\u2019s energy of the allowed orbits. The calculations of the allowed energies cut across atoms of other elements as well. In Bohr model the movement of the electrons around the nucleus does not result in electromagnetic radiation. Neil Bohr postulated the model basing it on Planck\u2019s theory of radiation. The means that an electron can lose or gain energy is by moving from one allowed energy level to another, emitting or absorbing electromagnetic radiation. The frequency at which the radiation occurs can be determined by the difference of the energy level.
