                An international labor organization has defined a trade union as
                an organization of workers authorized by the constitution who
                come together with a common goal of advocating and protecting
                the interests of workers. Trade unions are part of industrial
                relations which refers to the relations between the workers and
                the management in the industry. The position and nature of trade
                unions vary from country to country depending on the
                constitutional provision of the specific country. This essay
                will draw a comparison of the roles and position of trade unions
                in Germany and Sweden industrial systems; then the challenges
                they encounter and the strategies they have been using to
                maintain their position in the industrial system. First, what
                are the similarities between the trade unions in Germany and
                Sweden then the differences? Trade union in Germany and Sweden
                operates within the labor laws and industrial relations policies
                of the countries, respectively. The typical roles of the trade
                unions are to negotiate the collective bargaining on behalf of
                their members and the working conditions of their members. They
                face challenges they protect the employee's interest, but over
                time they have adopted ways to remain relevant in the industrial
                relations systems and markets.

                The trade unions in both Sweden and Germany negotiate for
                collective bargaining agreements whereby they negotiate for;
                wage agreements which refer to the rates of payment to the
                workers. They also negotiate for fair working conditions for the
                workers which are in this case they all advocate for safe and
                healthy working conditions for the employees clean working
                environment and non-discriminatory working environment. In terms
                of wages, they advocate for better wages for their members and
                employment promotion at the workplace. In Germany, the demands
                of the workers are presented to the union through the work
                council and the workers' representatives. In Sweden, the demands
                of workers are present to their respective trade unions from
                which they are taken for negotiation with the employer.

                In both countries, the trade unions help in internal and
                external conflict resolution. Internal conflict is the
                differences within the trade union members, and on the other
                hand, external conflicts are the differences between employees
                or the trade union with the employer. The Work council Germany's
                case helps in resolving the internal conflict within the
                industries while in Sweden, the union representatives ensure
                conflict resolution among the union members. In the arising of
                any external conflict, the trade union protects its members and
                their interests.

                Trade unions in both countries provide employment opportunities
                for its members. For instance, in Sweden, the trade unions help
                in solving cases of unemployment among its members by giving out
                unemployment funds to its members. In the case of Germany, the
                trade unions advocate for job opportunities for its members and
                ensure their job security is also protected. Besides, as a way
                of solving employment issues, trade unions in both countries
                work with employers to resolve labor issues. The trade union
                leaders in Sweden and the work council in Germany cooperate with
                the employers to mediate the grievances related to employment
                problems, with a motive of a win-win situation to ensure that
                both parties are satisfied with solutions found.

                In terms of their positions in the industrial relation systems,
                both the trade unions in Germany and Sweden are constitutionally
                recognized, and their formation and operations are provided for
                in the laws of the countries respectively. The rights and
                freedom of action that can be taken by the trade unions upon
                disagreement in the implementation of collective bargaining are
                provided for in the industrial relation laws of the two
                countries. Both trade unions in Sweden and Germany have a
                well-stipulated procedure and guidelines related to employee
                punishment hence ensuring constant good morals in the work
                environment. They also facilitate relationship building where
                employees share their goals and objectives with their employees.
                This ensures positive industrial relations at the same time,
                creating a good rapport between not only organizations but also
                employers and employees. Provision of legal advice to the
                members or course of action to be taken in case such need

                In Germany, union membership is restricted exclusively to the
                industry or the company an employee works for. It is called the
                one company-one union principle whereby you only subscribe to
                the union that is linked to your employer. This implies an
                employee cannot join any other trade union apart from the one
                suggested by the employer. In contrast, in Sweden, any worker is
                free to join any union they which even if it is not linked to
                the organization the employee is working for. This gives the
                employee free will to join the trade union they feel will give
                them satisfaction in terms of presentation in the matters of
                industrial relation.

                The trade unions in Germany are subjected to strict rules and

                industrial action to be taken like strikes the employer decide
                on how long the strike will take or the course of action to be
                taken whereas in Sweden the trade unions members follow the
                agreement as per the collective agreement and take actions like
                a strike in case the agreement has not been implemented. They
                are not dictates in any way by the employers.

                The work council in German is obligated to maintain peace and
                collaborate with the company they work for. Any internal
                differences should be resolve by them without taking the matter
                directly to the trade union. In contrast, in Sweden the trade
                union advocates for a mutual and harmonious relationship between
                the union members and the employer and in case of any conflict,
                reconciliation is the best way proposed for solving the
                differences. Thus, there is a lot of democracy in Swedish union
                leadership than in German trade union leadership (Pulignano et

                The general trade union membership in Sweden is at 70%, and this

                while for Germany the number of employees in trade unions is
                deficient at 13%. Most Organizations in Sweden are linked to
                various trade unions depending on the choice of the employee to
                which trade union to join. Still, in Germany, the organizations
                or industries subscribe to only one trade union due to their
                strict rules on formation adjoining of trade unions by employees
                (Bengtsson, 2017, pg.161-175).

                The position wage negotiation by the trade unions in Sweden is
                at a better level since the low average wage for a worker is
                relatively high compare to Germany where there is a fixed wage
                rate according to the industrial rules of the company or
                industry. Within each sector of the industry minimum wage is
                set, and this is paid to the employees in various industries.

                The trade unions in Sweden have a lot of power and influence due
                to the high number of employees in the country registered to
                various trade unions. This gives the union ns a better position
                to negotiate for their members' interests in the job market. In
                contrast, in Germany, few employees belong to trade unions, and
                this makes the unions less healthy to influence significant
                decisions made by the state entailing laws and regulations of
                labor-related issues. The number of members in a union gives
                power or limits strength and the position in the industrial
                relation systems. (Waddington and Hoffmann, 2000, pg.27-79)
                Despite the efforts dedicated by the trade unions to advocate
                and protect the interests of their members, they have
                experienced various challenges in these two countries.

                Gaining balance between the efforts towards unemployment
                reduction while at the same time fighting against inflation has
                been a challenge to the Swedish trade unions. Advocating for
                unemployment reduction is one of the prominent roles of trade
                unions in Sweden. At the same time, inflation is a matter to be
                looked into since it can lead to a negative impact on the living
                standards of the union members. Therefore, the union has to
                balance the employment provisions to the members and the treat
                of the rise of living standards among members. Striking a
                balance between the two aspects is crucial for the welfare of
                the union members and the economy of the country (Kjellberg,
                2000, pg.529-73).

                The trade unions have experienced difficulties in ensuring the
                Sweden wage system is compatible with anticipated future
                connection to economic and monetary union. This is to avoid a
                circumstance where there will be competition between various
                European countries on how the wages are being paid, and this
                scenario can bring about an unemployment crisis. The minimum
                wage for an average worker in Sweden is relatively high compared
                to any other country internationally. This is very beneficial to
                the employees and outstanding achievement to the trade unions as
                it is evident the collective agreement has been well negotiated.
                However, this causes a mismatch with other countries' wage
                rates. Sweden has a responsibility to ensure the rates of wages
                being paid for workers do not exceed the standards of other
                countries belonging to the economic and monetary union
                (Andersen, 2006, pg.29-47).

                The challenge of coordinating micro-level adjustments required

                bargaining of the collective agreement, specifically wages
                negotiation. The trade unions in Sweden still balances t6he wage
                rate negotiation concerning the standards of other European
                countries. To achieve this, the Sweden unions' power needs to be
                reduced, which in these cases poses a challenge to the power and

                Widening gaps between different categories of workers is a
                challenge to the trade unions. The achieve this the trade union
                has to encourage increment of the wage differential between
                workers, and this does not bring harmony to all the union,
                members since some of them will be affected negatively. State of
                regulation is was a challenge to the trade unions in Sweden
                whereby the trade unions were required to look into a tripartite
                approach of collective bargaining. The main agenda was to look
                into the wage reforms in the labor market. At this point, the
                trade unions had to make some reforms in the wages distribution
                formula.

                dismantled the formidable resistance that was set by employee
                representation in transactional groups. This was aimed at
                promoting cooperation at the international union. Besides, the
                divergent trade union views on the economic, monetary union. The
                divided opinions by the trade unions in Sweden saw the unions in
                the manufacturing sector, and export traders preferred joining
                the European Union as it was going to benefit them. In contrast,
                other local unions' trade unions opted not to join as they saw
                it not to be beneficial—these divergent views brought about

                The trade unions were affected by the Taylorist-Fordist
                production, which exceeded its limit in mid -the 1970s. At that
                time the industries in West Germany began to fall, and the
                standard of living among the people rose. This brought about the
                shift of demand from one seller's to buyers' market—this forced
                adoption of flexible mass production, which in turn affected
                industrial relations practices. The industrial relations in
                Germany were framed in principle; one company has one union to
                represent the workers of which this scenario negatively affected
                the trade unions in the labor market. The prevailing economic
                condition in East Germany caused the undermining of sectoral
                agreements by the large companies that were reached in West
                Germany. This made it difficult for the trade union to protect
                the interests of its members (Gumbrell et al, 2013).

                The modernization process of society was advocated in terms of

                operated in, and this caused membership withdrawals from the
                unions. Expansion of tertiary and other services sector spoiled
                the traditional system of industrial relations, which in turn
                affected the number of job seekers and employees which directly
                affected the number of members joining the trade unions. The
                effect was felt because most of the trade unions were linked to
                the industries where the employees only could join the trade
                unions. Structural upheavals in East Germany caused mass
                unemployment to a total of 10% in the whole of Germany. The
                unemployment pressure caused the breaching of sectoral
                agreements by some companies. In some instances, the employees
                and work council were forced to make adjustments in terms of low
                wage payment and unpaid overtime with the reason that it is a
                way to prevent more job losses.

                The monopoly and autonomy of the trade unions are in question as
                members are not joining the unions, and others are leaving the
                associations. The agreements between the industry and the
                sectors are also at treat by this prevailing situation. All of
                this is a result of increasingly challenging economic conditions
                in West Germany and eastern Germany. The unions' position is
                threatened because, without enough numbers, they cannot
                successfully negotiate collective bargaining with the employers.
                As per the industrial relation constitution, the trade union
                with the work council and workers representatives at the company
                can easily direct and manage employees. The union of the
                European market and the globalization and internationalization
                of businesses has brought a need for reforms in the German
                economic model. The industrial relation system is under pressure
                to make the changes in their systems more so in the eastern part
                of Germany.

                The inadequate number of members in most of Germany's trade
                unions is also a risky matter of concern as it opens an
                opportunity for collaboration with other countries. The
                introduction of the European monetary union will call for
                changes in the coordination of collective bargaining and
                collective wage agreements within the trade unions in the

                also posed to be serious problems. Only trade unions are allowed
                to negotiate a collective agreement but not the work councils,
                something which affects the presentation of employees'
                grievances by the work council.

                To achieve their objectives to maintain their positions in the
                industrial system, trade unions employ specific strategies that
                are worth noting. First, the use of collective bargaining has
                been employed as a way of achieving improved working conditions
                for their members. by so doing, they try to engage in
                negotiations with their employers to achieve better and improved
                wages and employment promotions for their members, more so in
                cases of inflation. Nonetheless, the constraint of labor supply
                has been intentionally employed by these trade unions as a way
                of restricting new entrants, to prevent an increase in labor
                supply. As a result, they were leading to an increase in wages
                (Anghelache et al, 2017, pg 145-158).
              </p>
              <p>
                The pressure by these trade unions on the government in a quest
                to foresee a legal minimum wage has also been a sound move.
                These trade unions put pressure on the government to ensure that
                it implements a legal minimum wage over which it would be
                illegal for any employee to pay wages below the standard
                requirement. By making workers more productive, these trade
                unions tend to increase the productivity of labor. Furthermore,
                to make them more productive, they provide regular pieces of
                training and advice a move that not increases their productivity
                but also leading to an increase in the organization's profits.
                The last resort to achieving and maintaining their positions in
                the industrial sectors involves tricks and demonstrations a way
                of articulating and presenting their grievances and getting
                their demands. Through mutual insurance, trade unions collect
                funds from their member, which is utilized to carry out some
                specific welfare plans that benefit their members. In case of
                emergency, the trade unions chip in by financially assisting
                their members. The fund also supports various operations of the
                union to ensure smooth running. For instance, payment of
                leaders, rent expenses, and any other crucial activity carried
                in the union. The money is collected from deductions arranged
                with the employer. They have funds to help the trade union carry
                out its stipulated role to the members.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from that, trade unions have been seen strengthening their
                position by expanding international cooperation through
                platforms like forums, confederation ad also by direct contact.
                The strategy entails building a network with other trade unions.
                The contact made helps the trade union learn current trends in
                trade union management and operations. Contacts made also are
                used for benchmarking from other trade union counterparts.
                Recruiting of new members like young men, women, small and
                medium enterprises owners, and employees from the informal
                sector strengthen the trade union's position and power in the
                industrial system of a country. Because by doing so, the number
                of union members will be increasing thus a positive impact on
                the trade union. The more members, the better position to
                negotiate the grievances of employees to the employer or the
                state.
              </p>
              <p>
                Formation of a new connection with organizations linked to the
                objectives of the trade union useful strategy in pushing for the
                trade union agenda this includes consumer groups and
                nongovernmental organizations. For instance, in cases of human
                rights issues, trade policy, and environmental development
                matters, the trade unions are always consulted since the issues
                affect the members they represent. In this situation, having
                good cooperation with the crucial organization involved gives
                the trade union an upper hand in pushing the grievances of its
                members and also protects their interests. The relevance of the
                trade union in the industrial relation system is at the same
                hand maintained.

                In conclusion, Trade unions play a vital role in a worker's
                presentation in any given industrial system. In both Sweden and
                Germany, it is evident the roles of the trade union is to
                negotiate better wages, improved working conditions, provide
                legal advice, and advocate for employment promotion for its
                members. However, besides their quest to promote better working
                conditions for their members, they are faced with various
                challenges that are worth noting—for instance, globalization and
                international competition, and technological changes. As a
                result to maintain their position in the industrial system the
                trade unions are employing strategic measures like collective
                bargaining, industrial actions like strikes and demonstrations,
                pushing for the implementation of minimum low wage law by the
                government.

                Even before the advent of the internet, change in the business
                environment was inevitable. Now with technological advancements,
                changes occur at even faster paces as compared to four decades
                ago. Organisational change is mandatory for any business to
                remain in contention for survival against rivals. For instance,
                amalgamation is one means of survival for businesses so as to
                improve their economies of scale. In the event of a merger,
                therefore, reorganisation is inevitable. The same applies to
                when there is a recession, often resulting in reduction of the
                labour force and consequently, restructuring. Organisational
                change is therefore simply a process of companies changing their
                ways of doing things to accommodate new developments. However,
                the definition has always been subject to debate and criticism
                with many scholars protesting against the association of change
                with large companies. Furthermore, whereas some people perceive
                change as inevitable, others view it as a planned phenomenon;
                others think it is limited to some individuals or people while
                yet others feel it is everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The one thing, however, that has remained incontestable, is the
                fact that change is a permanent feature of organisational life
                (Burnes, 2004). Hence, people have come up with several ways to
                try and manage change. Moran {"&"} Brightman (2001) define
                change management as “the process of continually renewing an
                organisation’s direction, structure, and capabilities to serve
                the ever-changing needs of external and internal customers.”
                From the definition, it is clear that every organisation has to
                assess its future ambitions and changes needed to achieve them.
                Not everyone accepts change openly. People have different
                reasons for accepting or resisting changes. While some people
                easily accept change and become willing to move along with it,
                some consider change an admittance to weakness (Hanke, 2019). It
                all narrows down to one’s perception of change in the concerned
                organisation. This paper therefore seeks to explain the
                different perceptions people have of organisational change and
                the resultant reactions to it they portray.
              </p>
              <h2>Functionalist Perspective</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                From this point of view, organisational change is considered a
                result of planning. It stems from the interplay between
                independent variables and dependent ones – in this case the
                change processes of an organisation. According to Tsoukas
                (1994), it is similar to being in a control room monitoring and
                regulating variables to ensure they remain within the required
                borders. The assumption behind this theory, therefore, is that
                there is a causal link between independent variables and the
                processes of change of an organisation – the dependent variable.
                The foundation to this approach is Kurt Lewin’s “changing as
                three steps” model (Cummings et al., 2015). Lewin explains
                organisational change in three phases: unfreezing, moving, and
                refreezing (Lewin, 1947). In the unfreezing stage, several
                driving forces necessitate the need for change in an
                organisation and hence planning begins. In the moving stage, the
                plans get implemented resulting in changes. The final stage,
                refreezing, features normalisation of the changes into an
                organisation’s system and schedule.
              </p>
              <p>
                People who perceive organisational change as a planned event
                picture it as an organised form of progression that is within
                control. John Kotter (1996) is a perfect example with his
                eight-step change model of organisational change. The eight
                steps are as follows:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Create Urgency: this is the stage where individuals in an
                    organisation are made aware of an existing problem and the
                    need to deal with it. To make them see the urgency, the
                    management can tell them that their jobs cling to the
                    success of the issue.

                    Form a Powerful Coalition: this step sees the creation of a
                    team that will help in the implementation of the objectives.
                    For effectiveness, it is vital to delegate roles to each
                    team member.

                    objective. It becomes more effective if it is easily
                    understandable.

                    to clear them without causing any interferences elsewhere.

                    Create Short-Term Wins: changes often take time to get
                    rooted and show results and as a result motivation levels
                    are bound to drop. However, creating short-term wins will
                    reinforce the investment and maintain the motivation and
                    interest of the staff.

                    Build on the Change: Kotter insisted on the need to continue
                    setting goals to ensure the process ends well. Many
                    organisations do not follow up their goals to the end and
                    hence tend get complacent towards the end. Carrying out
                    evaluations at intervals will help to ensure there are
                    improvements.

                    Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture: causing alterations
                    on some processes in an organisation does not guarantee a
                    cementation of a culture into an organisation. The
                    high-ranked staff members should show more dedication to the
                    change to encourage others to follow. Furthermore, new
                    arrivals should get introduced to the culture upon
                    arrival.(Kotter, 1996)
                  </li>
                </ol>
                Kotter came up with the above eight steps to illustrate that
                change is a complicated process that requires patience and
                caution. He outlines that up to 70% of change initiatives end in
                failure, something that many other scholars have backed (Kotter,
                1996; Sorge and van Witteloostjuin, 2004; Beer and Nohria,
                2000).

                Another functionalist model is the Business Process
                Reengineering. It is a process of improving an important aspect
                of a business so as to improve profit or performance. Just like
                Kotter’s model, it is not an easy task but is a necessary change
                for an organisation to identify its flaws. It follows the
                following steps:

                    However, with a big one, the process could be tiring.
                    However, if the staff do not get convinced, there might be
                    trouble ahead.

              <p>
                The functionalist perspective despite being popular has its
                weaknesses. One is that it lacks reality. Secondly, it has a
                tendency to oversimplify the process of change while casting
                aside the role individuals may have on change. Finally, it gives
                the top managerial staff too much supremacy and control.
              </p>
              <h2>Interpretivist Perspective</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The theory focuses on the different perceptions individuals may
                have on change. Hence, under this, every sensible opinion is
                welcome and is subject to backing or opposition. The major
                assumption in this point of view is that change is a process
                that involves addition of experience and influences.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                This theory like the former displays a weakness in how it limits
                the role of people and their interests in enforcing change.
                Furthermore, it paints an image of confusion and complexity in
                its representation of change. This is because there are infinite
                opinions and interpretations of change and influencing people to
                take a side is quite difficult.
              </p>
              <h2>Radical Perspective</h2>
              <p>
                This point of view criticizes the models constructed to explain
                change processes: the seemingly smooth nature of transitions. It
                recognises the change concepts but insists that each level has
                struggles. It is the perspective that considers the people
                affected by change and what they go through to cope. Ehrenreich
                in her book Nickel and Dimed (2006) discusses the struggles the
                poor go through earning peanuts and having to live on the
                earnings while struggling to raise their standards.
              </p>
              <h2> Post-structuralist Perspective</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Andre Spicer, in his article, talks about a new form of illness
                that seems to attack not only individuals but also
                organisations. He calls it the repetitive change syndrome. In
                the public sector, politicians would point out at areas in need
                of overhauls. The outcry would spread to the general public and
                consequently, something would have to be done about it (Spicer,
                2018). Similarly, Spicer goes on to narrate how the Swedish
                railways spend time and resources making changes every now and
                then. They would begin decentralising their operations only to
                start centralising them once again as soon as they get done. The
                pattern has been going on and on for years with the gap between
                the changes reducing as time goes (Spicer, 2018).
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The post-structuralist point of view considers change as an
                everyday omnipresent occurrence. The assumption is that nothing
                is permanent apart from change. With incessant globalisation,
                technological advancements, changing demographic trends and a
                growing knowledge workforce, change is the only thing that
                remains permanent (By, 2005). From the above instances by Andre
                Spicer, it is evident that change calls for further change.
                Nayak and Chia (2011) make the following assertion in their
                journal: “Social entities such as individuals and organizations
                are construed as temporarily stabilized event clusters
                abstracted from a sea of constant flux and change.” From this
                perspective, therefore, organisation is a temporary result
                stemming from the continuous process of organising (Tsoukas and
                Chia, 2002). Whereas organisation is a result of language use,
                change results from interactions and sharing of new meanings
                within an organisation. Administrators have a responsibility to
                observe what is going on in the organisation and also provide
                direction on the way to go.
              </p>
              <h2>Resistance to Change</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Human beings naturally do not like change for various reasons.
                Some feel that it interferes with their comfort zones while
                others just like satisfying their ego by always having their
                way. However, in the event of change being favourable and
                beneficial, very few people would resist. As earlier mentioned,
                change is a gradual process and sometimes not a smooth one.
                Hence, one of the main contributors to resistance is the lengthy
                process of waiting. Most people want instant results and the
                thought of waiting for a long time sparks rebellion.
              </p>
              <p>
                . Resistance does not, however, have to be a negative thing.
                Sometimes resistance is a tool for positive results. Courpasson
                et al. (2012) discuss three ways in which resistance can be
                productive. One way is how workers can use resistance as a
                negotiation tool for better work rates, rules and other small
                changes. Secondly, resistance, though small, has an influence on
                the management of a firm. Even though boycotting of work can be
                quelled easily in an organisation, it will most likely stimulate
                action from the managerial staff. Thirdly, what change agents
                may view as resistance, could also be a counteroffer from the
                change recipients’ point of view (Courpasson et al., 2012).
                Hence, in essence, resistance could be a form of feedback from
                the change recipients (Courpasson et al., 2012). There are
                several approaches to resistance to organisational change, some
                of which are discussed below:
              </p>
              <h2>Traditional Approach</h2>
              <p>
                This approach demonises or portrays resistance as a social ill
                that is an enemy to organisational change. Hence any form of
                resistance gets met with violent thwarting. Geisler (2001)
                equates this approach with the ‘bottom feeders’ who are ever
                against change for fear that it would mess with their food
                source. Managers in this approach have absolute power to
                implement change and deal harshly with resisters.
                Metaphorically, managers are angelic beings and those resisting
                change are demonic and hence, cannot have their way.
              </p>
              <h2>Contemporary Approach</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                This approach celebrates resistance by looking at the
                potentially positive intentions communicated in the resistance.
                Unlike the former, change agents under this approach back
                resistance and try to harness its benefits (Lüscher and Lewis,
                2008). Rather than question the reason behind resistance, they
                should seek to know why the move is perceived as a resistance.
                This approach perceives a resistance as a counteroffer to the
                change agent. It is up to the change agent to interpret the
                feedback and determine the best course of action.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The choice on whether to embrace or perceive change in an
                organisation depends on an individual’s perception of change.
                There are four broad categories of people when it comes to
                dealing with change. The first category is the people in denial
                (Hanke, 2019). They are usually aware of their shortcomings but
                their ego would not allow them to admit and learn. Hence, they
                stubbornly resist change believing that they can do without it.
                The second category is the argumentative people. Their instincts
                always tell them to argue against everything they hear. They
                always believe that they are right regardless of how insensible
                they sound. The third category is the inquisitive kind. They are
                a bit more open to ideas and opinions from other people but they
                are ever insecure. They are easier to help as compared to the
                former because even though they have doubts, they are possible
                to convince. The last category is the willing and able kind.
                They understand the significance of change to their daily lives
                and are always ready for any new ideas.
              </p>
              <h2>Conclusion </h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The pace of organisational change has hit new high levels never
                seen before. The change emanates from all round: internally and
                externally, and comes in unexpected magnitudes. Hence, to cope
                with the pressures and ever increasing competition of the
                current business environment, it is important for organisations
                to understand change. As seen in the discussion, there are many
                perceptions and meanings to organisational change. To some
                people, it is a good thing worth embracing. To some others, it
                is a demon worth banishing. The difference in individual
                perceptions of organisational change is what makes its meaning
                slippery and contested.

                {" "}
                The aim of this study is to assess a 5-year strategic marketing
                plan of the electric vehicle producers, where Tesla
                Manufacturers will be analyzed in the case study. The report is
                due to the fact that the designed strategy has influenced the
                company in numerous ways .The strategy initiated by the company
                following the incorporation of the Apple Company has led to
                improved technology to the whole of Tesla .The strategy was
                designed to outdo the traditional approach used by the
                Automobile Industry manufactures who supported rapid production
                of the services and large scale marketing. The report will
                design its study using the qualitative technique to facilitate
                analysis of the company. The report will incorporate reviews and
                data from varied scholarly studies based on approaches from the
                Apple Company. The conclusion of the case study is the ability
                of the electric vehicles to expand and develop more in other
                continents. The report also concludes the viability of the
                company to remain outstanding compared to other automobile
                industries. Finally, a strategy is to be designed to facilitate
                the company from expanding globally and increasing its marketing
                segmentation.

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                The Tesla motor company is an organization known for its ability
                to manufacture and create electric vehicle and motor cars. Since
                the earlier periods, Tesla Company is recorded to be the only
                enterprise that manufactured an electric motor sports car that
                did emit limited and lesser gases to the environment. In 2016,
                an approach was designed in Europe with an objective of
                establishing a mobile industry that emits lower gases to the
                environment. In this regard therefore, it supported the
                initiative designed 2011 to help promote lesser and fewer
                emission of gases by the vehicles. The mission led to the
                establishment of a transport white paper strategy that
                facilitated reduction of gases polluted by the transportation
                sector. Based on this approaches, the E-vehicles will be
                supported by many as it will be able to achieve the set
                objectives of the report. However, the EVS do impact negatively
                to the environment in some cases due to the harmful gases
                emitted by the greenhouses and the system used to manufacture
                the vehicles (Agnew {"&"} Dargusch, 2017). The EVs however have
                lower greenhouse gas emission compared to that of the Internal
                Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEV).Based on this fact therefore,
                the report aims at evaluating the strategic success plan for the
                electric mobility in Europe nations. Therefore, the innovation
                led to the establishment of the Tesla cars that had been
                designed using advanced technologies to make it more unique and
                attractive to many customers. The Tesla Company has therefore
                incorporated the shaped availed by the Apple Company to help
                redesign shapes that different from its competitors such as Ford
                (Agnew {"&"} Dargusch, 2017).

                The E-vehicles in the current world is realizing a positive

                Despite the outlined goals described above, Tesla Motors has
                faced challenges that is making it difficult to expand its
                market due to factors such as increased prices, designs of
                vehicles were negatively received by the customers and the
                varieties of the available batteries are limited. To help the
                industry survive, tesla incorporated a strategy from the Silicon
                Valley Company to market its products (Ingram, 2018). The
                marketing approach is based on the Apple Company strategy that
                incorporates the Macintosh devices hence mobilizing the
                expansion of the product being sold.
              </p>
              <h3> Marketing Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The approach used in Tesla Motors is based on the adopted
                strategy of Apple marketing strategic plan to help develop the
                technological advancement in the market (Galloway et al., 2017).
                The strategy therefore assumes the fact that the improvised
                approach would target the able customers who would be able to
                afford the expensive products innovated from the advanced
                technology. Based on this fact, Tesla created its first vehicle
                the roadster into the “early adopters” to help promote the
                advanced technology before it would subside its prices.
                Nevertheless, the approach limited its use in global areas as
                the design favored production of high quantity and reduced
                prices at the market. In this regard, tesla is forced to compete
                more companies that have invested more in the technological
                advancement and production of motor vehicles that use gasoline.

                Therefore, as Tesla decides to change its marketing strategy to
                the S-approach it has to incorporate the use of high-end
                segmented autos (Galloway et al., 2017) .This is based on the
                Apple approach to help it succeed in bigger marketing goals
                .Therefore, it has the role of ensuring the needs of key
                stakeholders such as customers has been incorporated to enhance
                its viability in the economy.
              </p>
              <h3> Strategy of the Brand</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                This majorly involves the ability of the company to design a
                differentiated product that has a unique means of selling in the
                market (Galloway et al., 2017). Therefore, it majorly involves
                the method used in restructuring the products in the market to
                provide it with a unique structure to facilitate its survival in
                the market. As the company designs the arrangement of the brand,
                it needs to consider the ability of the structure to motivate
                more customers into the market. The needs of the customers
                should be satisfied by the arrangement of the brand to
                facilitate satisfaction of the desired needs. This in mind, the
                physical appearance of Tesla and structure of the Electric
                vehicles will be of high innovation and will mobilize more
                customers to purchase the products.
              </p>
              <h3>Market Segmentation Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                This strategy incorporates the subdivision of the consumers
                based on the willingness to purchase the product in the
                segmented market to help divide the desires of the consumers
                based on their perceptions. The aim of the division is to
                arrange the consumers into different classes to help evaluate
                the similarity from the comparisons from the varied market
                segments designed. In this case therefore, Tesla Company is to
                design a strategy that would accommodate segmentation of the
                market in each market share. Tesla will be productive in this
                case by subdividing the electric sports cars to penetrate the

              <h3> Product Design and Pricing Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                The product design approach is based on the physical appearance
                of the products in the enterprise and the ability of the
                arrangement to avail a better way of mobilizing consumers to
                purchase the product. Based on the increased competition in the
                economic world, the structure of products in the organization
                play a vital role in mobilizing consumers to purchase their
                product. The aim of the strategy is to enable the tesla industry
                produce a product of the sedan design that would accommodate
                seven passengers and that would be environmental friendly. On
                the other hand, the pricing strategy has to support the desired
                approaches chosen in the enterprise. The strategy desired for
                the pricing should be in line with the consumers of the
                enterprise and be able to support the desired goal for designing
                the strategy.
              </p>
              <h3> Sales and Service Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Tesla Motors do sell their products to the customers directly.
                It therefore makes use of the online services through liaising
                with the consumers via platforms such as mobile phones, and
                social networks. Based on this fact, Tesla imitates the approach
                of sales and services from the Apple Company .In 2011, it
                incorporated the management of Apple Company to help it restore
                its appearance. This led to the restructuring of the Tesla
                products in areas where customers would be able to access. The
                strategy will facilitate the formation of some offices in Tesla
                to be restructured for customer exhibition on aspects related to
                Tesla which in this case facilitates the ability of the company
                to inform consumers of key areas in the company. This will
                enable the company to design a design that would facilitate
                mobilization of retail centers and areas where the consumers
                would receive the direct services of Tesla Motors.
              </p>
              <h3>Marketing and promotional Strategy</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The strategy is geared towards ensuring Tesla Company achieves
                its motive of ensuring the electric vehicles are developed in
                the market. Based on this goal, the company has to ensure it
                avails continuous information related to the values of the
                company. The communication presented by the company should meet
                the needs of the key stakeholders or beneficiaries of the
                company such as customers. A promotional approach should be
                incorporated in the company to facilitate the ability of the
                products manufactured to be globally known by all consumers. In
                the current situation, the approach used by the company features
                promotion over a smaller area. In this case, a strategy has to
                be designed to cater for the ability of the strategy to reach
                global continents .The strategy should therefore assess the
                needs of different customers from the global market and evaluate
                the comparison of different consumers from different regions.

              <h2> Marketing Strategy Recommendations</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The Tesla Company should design a strategy that should initiate
                developmental innovations and products designs (Sathish, {
                  "&"
                }{" "}
                Weenk). In this case, the company has to ensure it emulates the
                strategies used by the Apple Company based on its historical
                inventions and innovations put in place.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Despite the continuous development of the Automobile industry
                innovating the electric vehicles, Tesla Company should focus to
                its main goal. To facilitate its survival technique in the
                competitive world, the company has to innovate strategies that
                would design unique and recommendable qualities of products that
                would motivate many.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The presence of awards and trophies in a company boosts the
                reputation of its brand which will in this case stimulate the
                ability of the customers being motivated to the product or
                service offered. In this case therefore, Tesla Company should
                present awards and trophies to the consumers through the
                promotional strategies to help create awareness of its
                viability.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Just as the trick used by the Apple Company on availing
                surprises to the consumers, the company succeeds in creating
                more attention to the customers (Sathish {"&"} Weenk). Tesla
                Company should in the same way avail surprises such as trading
                discounts and free gifts at a certain period to the customers.
                The strategy will in the same manner help the company increase
                the rate at which the company products are purchased and
                demanded.

                Design a strategy that would enable it to differentiate its
                products to help it survive the available competitors. The
                company should design a strategy that would improve the quality
                and physical design of the product to help it outdo the products
                manufactured by other industries innovating the electric
                vehicle.

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In line with the viability of the product, the quality of the
                product has to be innovated to facilitated growth of the
                electric vehicle. Therefore, Tesla Company has to lay down a
                strategy that would be used in achieving the desired Tesla
                objective and design an approach to be used in achieving the
                objective. The main attention of Tesla Company should mainly be
                geared towards achieving the desired goal as to why the strategy
                is laid down. Tesla Company should assemble all the required
                resources to be used in achieving the targeted motive. There is
                increased competition from different companies since most of the
                enterprises are working towards achieving an electric motor.
                Tesla should analyze this fact and ensure it draws all the
                existing similarity and modify the products to present a high
                tech and advanced product that is unique among the many
                available products. Globalization of the market should be
                considered by the company to enhance its ability to expand to
                the international market segments. The company has to improve
                its ability promote the product awareness by ensuring it
                develops a strategy that would facilitate its ability to inform
                consumers both from the domestic and international market on the
                viability of the product. The brand design is to be analyzed to
                ensure the company structure and organization is known and the
                reputation is maintained by the consumers of the product. The
                success of any given company is successful based on how the
                company avails its facts to help it mobilize customers to
                develop a positive attitude towards the desired goal of the
                company.

                rate at which coordination and planning of marketing activities
                are handled to achieve job satisfaction (Kotler et al., 2019).
                Analysis of the surrounding market plays a vital role in an
                organization. However, incorporating all this forces and actors
                in a market is a challenge to the management in ensuring
                organizational growth and development. Based on this fact,
                various organizations strive in ensuring marketing environment

                Any business enterprise forms part of the surrounding in which
                it carries its day to day activities. Based on this fact
                therefore, there exist no enterprise that would survive solely
                hence need to incorporate the key forces and actors that would
                develop its viability. The factors surrounding an enterprise can
                within its vicinity or far from its operation .However ,this
                factors do impact greatly to the value of the business in terms
                of how work is being done and how coordination of operations are
                done in an organization. These forces are divided into two major

              <h2>Micro environment vs. Macro environment</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Micro environment is defined as forces within the business
                enterprise which influence the operation of an organization
                (Kaplan and Violante, 2018). Therefore, it comprises of a
                collection of forces that are specific to an organization
                influencing the internal operations for a period of time either
                positively or negatively based on the current conditions the
                business works on. They include forces such as distributors who
                supply production inputs in the business, competitors who make
                an effort to outdo the services provided by the company, the
                supply chain intermediaries who facilitate the distribution of
                the products and services to the final consumer and the
                organizational structure which comprises of the enterprise
                investors, management and the shareholders (Kaplan and Violante,

                {" "}
                Macro environmental forces on the other hand comprises of the
                factors outside the management of an organization and that an
                organization lacks control of the forces affecting the operation
                of the enterprise. It compromises of the bodies, business
                organizations, groups, and people through which an organization
                comes into contact with. They include political conditions
                imposed on activities being carried in an organization,
                economical status of the individuals surrounding an
                organization, sociocultural norms and beliefs of the groups the
                organization serves, technological advancement supported in the
                market, environmental factors and the legal laws and rights of
                an organization. However the impact of the micro and macro
                environmental forces is varied depending on the rate of contact
                the forces do have in an organization as described below;
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The micro environmental forces are those within the organization
                while on the other hand the macro environment factors are those
                at the external surrounding of an organization. Micro
                environmental forces are geared towards a particular
                organization and that influence the operation of a specific
                organization while on the other hand the macro environment
                forces influence a group of business enterprise in a particular
                entity (Kaplan and Violante, 2018). The micro environment forces
                can to some extent be controlled by an organization while the
                organization lacks control of the macro environment .Influence
                of the micro environment in a business is felt internally and
                within which in this case is repetitive in nature while the
                impact of the macro environment is felt externally during
                organizational contact with the forces and the influence is long
                term (Kaplan and Violante, 2018). The assessment of the micro
                forces are through the COSMIC model while the macro forces are
                through the PESTLE model.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In conclusion, the composition of the business enterprise
                consists of both the micro and the macro forces hence they
                complement each other to facilitate organizational success.
                Management of an organization should in this case analyze the
                viability of the environment through which they operate .This is
                due to the fact that the two forces leads to the ability to
                assess organizational strength ,weakness, opportunities and
                threats.

                scanning is important based on Apple Inc.
              </h2>
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In the business world, success of an enterprise is mostly based
                on various factors that do influence organizational success. In
                this case therefore, approaches in line with environmental
                scanning tools are vital when designing a strategy that would
                facilitate organizational growth and development. In this study
                therefore, the report aims at analyzing market environment and
                finding reasons as to why an organization participates in
                analyzing and assessing the environment in which it is based in
                (Bond and Keys, 2020). Market environmental scanning refers to a
                situation where team members of a given organization are
                required to assess the environment outside its vicinity and
                mention the strength, weaknesses, threats and opportunities that
                would impact on the success of a business. After the
                identification of all the forces, the organizational management
                decide an approach that would be relevant to its need to achieve
                a desired goa (Bond and Keys, 2020)l. The approach chosen should
                be vital to all key respondents of the organization such as
                customers, distributors and shareholders and be able to evaluate
                the future benefits it would bring to the organization based on
                the external environment. Therefore, market environment scanning
                is relevant in an organization due to the reasons outlined and
                discussed below:
              </p>
              <h3>Ability to make decisions</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The analysis of a market environment enhances the ability of an
                organization to evaluate viability of many factors available in
                its vicinity and make appropriate and relevant choices. The type
                of decisions made in any situation an organization is in
                determine the viability of an organization ,therefore it is
                crucial for an organization to incorporate environmental
                scanning approach so as to make decisions that would facilitate
                success in the current environmental conditions. Analysis of the
                market will in this case enable Apple Inc. make appropriate
                decisions based on how its daily activities are handled (Bond
                and Keys, 2020). It would in this case be able to strategize
                ways to be used in innovating its products to fit the underlying
                marketing conditions.
              </p>
              <h3> Plan the future strategies</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In any business organization, availability of objectives to be
                achieved in a short period or longer periods are always designed
                in an organization (Bond and Keys, 2020).Ability of an
                organization to assess its environment will enhance the
                evaluation of approaches that would lead to organizational
                expansion in future. Therefore, this would enable an
                organization to assess the possible approaches to be used in an
                organization to facilitate achievement of the desired goals.
              </p>
              <h3> Facilitate expansion</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Analysis of the environment would in this case enable an
                organization to expand the strength in the business and reduce
                the weaknesses it does face ,make use of the benefits that
                accrue to its viability and diffuse the threats. Based on this
                fact, Apple Inc. has stimulated its expansion through
                initiatives that would stimulate its expansion by maximizing the
                strength and opportunities while it minimizes the weaknesses and
                threats in its operation. This factor makes the organization
                survive any forces in its environment and drive its growth and
                development strategies (Bond and Keys, 2020).
              </p>
              <h3> Resource planning</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                An organization with full knowledge of its environment will in
                the same way make proper decisions on how to allocate the
                relevant resources in the organization. It enables an
                organization find information on the availability of the
                existing relevant resources and acquire strategies that would
                facilitate its use of the resources based on the information
                acquired. Apple has designed the inbound logistics approach in
                its resource planning to enable it supply the output
                appropriately and plan on resources acquired to facilitate the
                achieved target (Bond and Keys, 2020).
              </p>
              <h3> Maintains an organizational position</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Environmental scanning enables an organization to identify the
                forces and actors that impact on its operation and determine
                appropriate adaptive strategies that would enable it survive
                existing conditions (Bond and Keys, 2020). This therefore
                enables an organization to identify the existing benefits and
                make use of it as it in the same way ensure the available
                challenges are handled before they become major in the long run.
                This will facilitate an organization to determine the changing
                consumer perceptions in the demand curve and adopt a strategy
                that would mitigate the negativity.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In conclusion, assessment of the environment is necessary to
                enable an organization adapt the radicle changes that would
                influence its operation. This would therefore facilitate the
                scanning of both the SWOT and PESTLE and find approaches that
                would enhance its development.

                to its unique designs of the products it does offer the global
                market. This has been facilitated through the coordination of
                the leadership approaches initiated in the company by Steve who
                uses the combination of both the transformational and
                situational strategy in directing the employees in the
                organization. Steve has in this approach identified ways through
                which would enabled him to be aware of methods that would expand
                job satisfaction of employees at work. He designed an approach
                that would give room for all employees to be incorporated in the

                employees have freedom to air out their views and perceptions
                based on the situation affecting the company. The approach
                boosts the confidence and esteem of the workers and in the same

                {" "}
                Apple Inc. handles many competitors such as Samsung, and

                maintains its reputation based on the high quality products it
                does offer in the market. Samsung products however do have the
                same quality hence termed as one of the major competitor of

              <p>
                {" "}
                During the Covid 19 period, Apple produced its financial state
                of the 2020 Q4 that elapsed on 26th Sept. 2020 and it realized a
                $64.7 billion revenue and $0.73 earnings from the shares with a
                59% of the sales volume from the foreign market (Li,and
                Tartarini, 2020). Based on this report therefore, it has faced
                innovations from the Mac and the services it offered. However,
                despite the pandemic, Apple is the outstanding product due to
                the establishment of the 5G network that yielded positive
                results to the company (Li and Tartarini, 2020). Due to the
                restriction of movement measures, most institutions and
                organization did impress remote working and this has increased
                the usage of the Apple products in the homes. In this regard,
                the employees in the organization do facilitate customer
                satisfaction using approaches incorporated with critical
                decisions and innovative ideas. Therefore, from the September
                fiscal year analysis, if Apple maintains the trend of the
                revenues and the earnings (Li and Tartarini, 2020).
              </p>
              <h3> Sociocultural Forces</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The pandemic has led to fear of most individuals who have in
                this case reduced their luxurious life style (Gvili, 2020). Most
                of the consumers demanded for the Apple products as a sign of
                prestige which in this case is a challenge as most distributors
                of the products have shut down over 40 industries distributing
                the products. The pandemic has in this case affected the sales
                volume of the industry since most key distributors of Apple are
                based in China. In this case, the supply of Apple mostly the
                iPhone did rely on China which in this case had reported a
                decrease in the supply of iPhone due to the decrease in demand
                of the product (Gvili, 2020). China is a state that was
                adversely hit leading to decreased sales volume from the shut
                suppliers and the reduced consumer needs of the product as most
                individuals were interested on their wellbeing other than the
                luxurious life style.
              </p>
              <h3> Technological Forces</h3>
              <p>
                Apple mostly relied on the technological skills of the Chinese
                supplies hence depended on the industry for the supply of the
                iPhone and various devices relevant in the organization (Gvili,
                2020). The company depends on China to provide the network
                technicalities which in this case is relevant for its major
                products. To enhance survival of this technological skills to
                the organization, the distributors in China have to work in line
                with the laid down rules and regulations to facilitate their
                development (Gvili, 2020). In this regard, the organization has
                used most of resources in devising strategies that would
                facilitate their growth and development. All the approaches
                should accommodate the radicle changes in the economical world
                which is a threat to the global Apple as it ensures all this
                measures are put in place to enhance viability of the
                organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In conclusion, despite the major impacts the organizations are
                facing based on the current crisis, the management has to keep
                in mind the pandemic is faced by almost all enterprises in the
                economy .In this case therefore, the organization has to design
                approaches that would incorporate the measures specified by the
                state.

               <h2>Report to the Management of Cadbury World</h2>
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The Cadbury World has been in existence since the 1820s having
                been recorded as the world's leading chocolate producer for more
                than 200 years. The company was established in the year 1824 by
                John Cadbury who concentrated on coffee and tea planting. John
                Cadbury was a Quaker hence believed the plantation of coffee was
                social honor that did consider social values and virtues
                (Fincham, and Burton 2020). Therefore, to the Quaker's
                perception of coffee, John Cadbury was able to produce Cadbury
                since it was based on the social aspects of the community that
                John Cadbury inhabited (Fincham, and Burton 2020). Therefore,
                taking the social aspects in place the company was created
                following the virtues related to Cadbury. As of now, Cadbury has
                expanded to different regions of the globe with an estimated
                number of employees of over 50,000 persons and suppliers of more
                than 35,000 (Fernandes, Chaudhuri, and Vidyasagar, 2017). Daily,
                the company has recorded many persons demanding their products
                that do come in different varieties such as dairy milk, eclairs,
                and flakes. All this has made the company survive in the growing
                economy due to various successful reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Therefore, based on the analysis of the company, the success has
                been in line with its vital value for formation that is based on
                its employee's endurance and sustainable motive of its products
                in the market (Fernandes, Chaudhuri, and Vidyasagar, 2017). The
                means of ensuring the Cadbury name is upheld has made the
                company grow beyond measure as each CEO has to ensure the name
                inherited is re-established (Olojede et al., 2020). The products
                of Cadbury have undergone numerous promotions depending on the
                kind of target group it wishes to satisfy for many generations
                since its establishment. Finally, Cadbury has survived in
                different economic patterns making it a successful product in
                the confectionery market. However, despite the success of the
                Cadbury World, Cadbury is aware it needs to be innovated and
                improved further (Olojede et al., 2020). Therefore, this case
                study aims to analyze the current situation at the Cadbury World
                and lay down appropriate recommendations relevant to the
                Cadbury.
              </p>
              <h2>Findings and Discussion of the Cadbury World</h2>
              <strong>Observation of the Cadbury World</strong>
              <br />
              <p>
                {" "}
                The Cadbury World was mainly established with a public
                perception of satisfying the leisure time of different people of
                varied ages (Nordberg, 2020). The main reason for its
                establishment has been with its background development and the
                success it did receive from one generation to the next. Since
                time memorial, the Cadbury world has attracted different
                families who have enhanced the rate of the profit margins to the
                company. Since its establishment, therefore, the Cadbury World
                has registered numerous successes (Nordberg, 2020). However, the
                continued success led to numerous concerns based on how the
                company was operated and aspects of management. Different from
                the expectations of the customers, the Cadbury World was faced
                with long queues which made different customers find a way they
                would revolve the Bourneville industry. The samples to be viewed
                by interested customers were perceived differently by the
                customers who contradicted the vision of the management
                (Nordberg, 2020). The prices of the retail Cadbury World shop
                were unaffordable to most customers who in return viewed the
                prices as gift shops other than factory shops.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                However, the management solved the problem by developing a
                timed-ticket approach that led to increased accessibility of the
                company to many customers to date in the Cadbury World tourism
                avenues. Issues related to the pricing of the product became a
                bigger challenge to the company since the gift shop perception
                was based on major innovations that would interrupt the
                developed commercial cooperation that had been established. In
                this case, therefore, Cadbury World had to put into
                consideration the availability of other retailers in the market
                since it was viewed to be a big challenge to its competitors
                (Nordberg, 2020). An approach was therefore developed to form a
                price that no competitor of the Cadbury would charge higher than
                them hence led to the establishment of a "bargain corner" also
                known as the "factory area". The approach led to retail avenues
                which are" The World's Largest Cadbury Shop" and, "Essence
                Emporium" (Nordberg, 2020). The avenues in return mobilized the
                customers' satisfaction on the use of the Cadbury chocolate,
                increased the rate of income and efficiency of money, and
                increased the value of how the Cadbury products were created.
              </p>
              <strong>The Objective of the Cadbury World</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The main reason as to why the company was established was
                basically to form a tourism avenue and be able to satisfy the
                needs of the customers who were unable to use the Bourneville
                products (Suhas, 2020). During the formation of the company, the
                Bourneville products had been faced with varied health issues
                which led to the general public concern. Hence, therefore, its
                main objective is based on the health issues that were raised by
                the public during its merging with the Schweppes in the year
                1969. Its vision was designed through a message to the public
                that did state "Cadbury means chocolate means fun" (Suhas,
                2020). To enhance its vision, Cadbury World has been working
                under objectives such as: Ensuring the customer's preference is
                in line with the Cadbury and be able to maintain their loyalty
                to their customers. However, in the current days' issues related
                to health have arisen leading to most customers strategizing
                their Cadbury purchasing decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In line with the emerging health issues, the state of different
                countries felt the need to design policies that would cater for
                the nutrition of children through the provision of the program
                that would facilitate desired proper dietary. This strategy has
                affected the Cadbury World business as most individuals are
                avoiding any food staffs that would endanger their health, which
                in this persons are moving away from chocolate consumption. In
                order for the Cadbury world to survive the changing options, it
                has to modify its product to fit health specifications required
                by the individuals' who would wish to live healthily. The
                strategy should therefore be planned with consideration of the
                number of fats present in the chocolate and mobilize customers
                to accept the chocolate as it would be essential for their
                health too (Suhas, 2020). Due to the inability of the Cadbury
                World to achieve its key objective, an assessment of the
                problems faced by the Cadbury world will be analyzed and
                possible solutions are given to facilitate the implementation of
                the desired strategies.

              <h2>Analysis of the Cadbury World</h2>
              <strong>Handling of the Customers</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The Cadbury World mostly uses feedback from the customers'
                approach as a way of handling their customers in the company
                (Journal of Management Value {"&"} Ethics, p.74). Based on the
                analysis of this approach, the result showed a slower pace of
                reports being delivered to the company. In this case, therefore,
                the approach has to be switched which in this case, Jonathan
                Winchester was approached and presented an approach he did use
                in his company. The approach used since their meeting has then
                been the insight6 feedback (Journal of Management Value {"&"}{" "}
                Ethics, p.74). Since then, Cadbury World has received effective
                reports that have enhanced the branding of the company in
                different regions.
              </p>
              <strong>Solution</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                To assess the perception of the customers based on the company,
                a map has to be designed including the 14 regions of the Cadbury
                World. A report has to be established based on the views and
                perception of the customers in all these regions chosen (Journal
                of Management Value {"&"} Ethics, p.74). The views should be
                based on how the customers interact with the operational
                workforce and the tourists and evaluate the services being
                provided (Journal of Management Value {"&"} Ethics, p.74).
                Customer satisfaction is one key factor as to why an enterprise
                is developed, based on this fact, therefore, a learning program
                has to be designed for the employees of the company to help
                facilitate customer satisfaction in the company. Therefore, the
                members of Cadbury World have to be taken through a program that
                would facilitate the delivery of customer service and how to
                increase the customer purchasing power of the Cadbury products.
              </p>
              <strong> Poor storage of the Cadbury chocolate</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The Cadbury chocolate was poorly stored in one of the regions
                within Cadbury World in China-Mumbai on 3rd February 2020
                (Kasirye, Radwan, and Kriya, 2020). The poor storage led to the
                intrusion of worms in the Cadbury chocolate on the Western sides
                of Andheri. The same problem had been reported earlier in the
                aligned regions of Akurdi, and Pune. This led to the increased
                concern of the health officials such as the Maharashtra Drugs
                and Food bodies who came into action immediately. They banned
                the storage of manufactured Cadbury products in the whole of the
                country (Kasirye, Radwan, and Kriya, 2020). The report then
                concluded the dangers of worm infestation in the chocolate plant
                especially when the product is poorly stocked. In line with the
                problem, the Cadbury world has been faced with storage
                challenges due to poor means of packing the chocolate. This has
                led the Food and Drug Administration officer Uttam Khobragade,
                to view the product as unfit for human consumption. The problem
                tampered with the reputation of the Cadbury world leading to a
                reduced sales volume of below 30% which was below their expected
                target (Kasirye, Radwan, and Kriya, 2020). The negative
                perceptions and views of the chocolate product led to the
                inability of the company to promote its product further hence
                remained unadvertised for over a month increasing the rate of
                losses in the company.
              </p>
              <h2>Recommendations after Analysis</h2>
              <strong> Project Vishwas</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The first strategy for the Cadbury World to emulate is to design
                a project Vishwas that will majorly compromise an educational
                motive to the retailers affected by the company, the customers
                who loved the Cadbury world products, the working force of the
                company, and lastly the consumers of the chocolate product
                (Fujiwara, 2020). The project should be able to educate all
                these key stakeholders by incorporating conditions as designed
                below:
              </p>
              <strong> To the traders of the products,</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The educational program should incorporate conditions such as;
                Survey of the retails strategy that would facilitate the
                evaluation of the quality of all retailers in most of the
                Cadbury world retailers and train the key stakeholders on
                appropriate means of storing the chocolate product. The Cadbury
                world has to resurrect its reputation by laying down the
                originality of its products by providing pamphlets from the
                retail press composing of the true information based on
                strategies laid down in the company. A copy of the pamphlets
                should be given to the traders to help them liaise with the
                customers on the fact concerning the company (Fincham, and
                Burton, 2020). A feedback mechanism should be availed to the
                retailers via means such as telephone numbers or emails to help
                receive reports on the impact of the strategy to the traders.
              </p>
              <strong> To the social networks</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The chocolate products were mainly advertised through the media
                platforms available hence it is a necessity to lay down a
                strategy that would incorporate the media in rebuilding the
                previous reputation. In this case, therefore, the
                recommendations and the strategies to be laid down with these
                facts will be as summarized (Bell, 2017). The Cadbury world has
                to lay down the strategies to be used by the company is reviving
                its reputation and ensure the initiated plans to reach the
                customers. In this case, therefore, the company has to ensure
                the media gets the necessary information on changes the company
                would incorporate as the media passes the same to the customers.
                The management of the company should be available for the reach
                of the media company and ensure they are answerable to all
                questions that might arise (Kasirye, Radwan, and Kriya, 2020).
                The ability to respond to the arising questions from the media
                will facilitate the ability of the media to convince the
                consumers to choose the Cadbury world products.
              </p>
              <strong> To the working force</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The company has to ensure they involve all employees in any
                actionable plan that is being strategized in the company
                (Kasirye, Radwan, and Kriya, 2020). The employees have to be
                scheduled meetings that would facilitate the education and
                necessary actions that would be initiated in the company.
                Communication should be mobilized between the management and
                employees on any program that has to be attended to keep each
                team of the company in the picture of the plan being
                implemented.
              </p>
              <strong> Repackaging of the chocolate product</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Since the packaging of the chocolate became one of the key
                concerns by the health administrators, the company has to
                introduce a packaging that would cover all the quantity of the
                chocolate (Krishna, 2020). The use of aluminum material that is
                sealed with heat will provide a maximum guard of the chocolate
                packed. The initiated double pack material should be availed to
                the media to enable the consumers to be aware of the changes
                that have been made in the company (Fernandes, Chaudhuri, and
                Vidyasagar, 2017). The media should be able to lay down the
                differences between the previous and the recommended pack to the
                customers for them to see and understand the safety of the
                repacked Cadbury world products.
              </p>
              <strong> Increased campaign</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The company has to launch a campaign that would be able to
                mobilize a group of customers to gain confidence in the product
                being created at the Cadbury world company (Fernandes,
                Chaudhuri, and Vidyasagar, 2017). The campaign should be
                facilitated by increased expenses on how the product would be
                promoted to help change the perceived information of the
                customers regarding the product.
              </p>
              <strong> Viability of the Recommendations</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The described recommendations would enable the company to be
                aware of each activity being carried out in the organization
                till the chocolate reaches the consumers (Fernandes, Chaudhuri,
                and Vidyasaga, 2017). The market segmentation of the Cadbury
                world chocolate would increase hence increase the profit margins
                to be realized in the company as a whole. Increased market
                segmentation will automatically increase the Cadbury world share
                portion in the market as most consumers will be attracted to the
                company.

                {" "}
                In conclusion, despite the challenges faced by the Cadbury
                World, it has proved to be one of the major tourist attraction
                centers in Birmingham. In this case, it has recorded an estimate
                of over 500,000 persons coming to the avenue annually (Fujiwara,
                2020). The center layers out a program to its tourist for them

              <h2>Introduction </h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Costa Coffee is a coffee chain that has its headquarters in the
                United Kingdom. It is a subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company that
                acquired it in 2019 from Whitbread (Wood {"&"} Sweney, 2018). It
                ranks second in the industry worldwide falling behind Starbucks
                in first. Costa Coffee is, however, the leading coffee chain in
                the UK where it has the greater part of the market share.
                Currently, Costa Coffee has a total of 3401 stores spread across
                31 countries mainly in the European and Asian continents.
              </p>
              <h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Costa Coffee has benefitted a lot from its association with the
                Coca-Cola Company and coupled with its global presence, form
                part of its strengths. However, over the years, negative
                customer reviews have been its undoing, hence becoming a major
                weakness. Continual expansion of its coverage and the positive
                stance for tourism continues to provide growth opportunities to
                the company. The outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic and the
                constantly changing buyer preferences are some of the threats
                the company faces.
              </p>
              <strong>Strengths</strong>
              <p>
                Firstly, the company has and continues to benefit from its
                association with Coca-Cola. After the take-over, the company
                began operating as a subsidiary of Coca-Cola and as a result, it
                benefits from the strong position the parent company enjoys in
                the service sector. Coca-Cola has a large business presence in
                Europe, the Middle-East and Africa (EMEA), Eurasia, Latin
                America, North America and Asia-Pacific (Costa Ltd. SWOT
                Analysis, 2020). Furthermore, Costa benefits from Coca-Cola’s
                expertise in management, innovations and governance practices
                (Costa Ltd. SWOT Analysis, 2020).
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Secondly, the company’s presence in several countries and
                through regions has helped to build its global market share.
                Post-acquisition from Whitbread, the company opened several
                coffee shops in the different regions it covers. Furthermore, it
                installed over 8000 self-serve machines in the countries it
                operates in and especially in the UK. All its outlets offer a
                variety of products under their menus that comprise not only
                beverages, but also foods and fruit juices.
              </p>
              <strong>Weaknesses</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Firstly, negative review against the company have been affecting
                its operations for quite a while. Some of the complaints from
                the customers include delays in some stores due to long queues,
                poor hospitality from the staff and hiked up prices in their
                menus. In 2018 there were multiple complaints over their serving
                of burnt toast and serving wrong beverages and not the ones
                ordered. The review could potentially affect the growth of the
                company if prospective customers read them.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Secondly, the company has limited aggressiveness in terms of
                expansion. In comparison to the top ranked Starbucks, the gap
                between the two is huge and Costa will need to be more
                aggressive to close it. Both companies started in 1971 but
                currently Starbucks has its operations in about 80 countries
                whereas Costa covers only 31 countries.
              </p>
              <strong> Opportunities</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Firstly, the company is focusing on expanding its store
                networks. In the financial year 2019, it announced to install 89
                self-serve machines in the UK. Besides that, Costa also plans to
                open 61 new stores. With the focus on expansion, the company has
                an opportunity to improve its performance and strengthen its
                brand recognition.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Secondly, Costa Coffee stands to benefit a lot from the positive
                outlook for the global sector of Travel and Tourism. The T&T
                industry’s contribution to the world’s GDP is set to increase
                according to the World Travel and Tourism Council ((Costa Ltd.
                SWOT Analysis, 2020)). Costa has an opportunity to benefit
                greatly from the T&T industry.
              </p>
              <strong>Threats</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The coronavirus pandemic claimed many human lives and the
                consequent protection measures impacted the economy negatively.
                Isolations, lockdowns and quarantines affected international
                trade and economic activities. The move to close down pubs and
                restaurants directly affected the company’s chain and could
                likely result in reduced profits in the financial year 2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Secondly, there are constant changes in the foodservice industry
                with regards to customer tastes and preferences. As such, the
                company needs to adjust continually to the latest demands or
                risk falling behind their competitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Finally, Costa Coffee faces indirect competition from other
                players. Tea is the major problem with its consumption both in
                the UK and China increasing over the years and surpassing
                coffee. As a result, its brand value is dropping gradually.
                Porter’s Five Forces Analysis
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Porter’s Five Forces of Competitive Position Analysis evaluates
                the competitive strength and position of a firm in an industry.
                The basis of the theory is that there are five forces
                responsible for the competitive attractiveness and intensity of
                a market. Besides showing an organization’s position, it shows
                the position a firm looks to advance to. Coffee is one of the
                most popular beverages in the world with its consumption varying
                among countries due to specific factors. The industry collects
                over $100 billion annually and continues to grow with time
                (Menke, 2018). Some of the major players in the industry include
                Starbucks Corp, Costa Coffee, The Lavazza Group, Dunkin’ Brands,
                Nestle, Unilever and Gloria Jeans. Porter’s Five Forces Analysis
                gives a deeper understanding of the industry.
              </p>
              <strong>Competitive Rivalry </strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Despite the industry having a positive growth of 5% annually, it
                has intense competition within. Starbucks leads the way in terms
                of revenue collection per year at $22.38 billion. The second
                placed, Tim Horton, has a revenue collection of $3billion per
                year – a large gap from the first. Costa Coffee occupies fifth
                place – behind Panera Bread and Lavazza – with $900 million per
                year. Other honorable mentions are Peet’s Coffee, Dunkin Donuts
                and Caribou at sixth to eighth place respectively. All the
                companies are internationally acceptable and have immense
                financial capabilities to compete favorably. Buyer Power
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The bargaining power of customers in this industry is high due
                to the numerous providers available with little variation of
                products. Even though there are customers loyal to specific
                brands, the loyalty is not strong to make an impact.
                Furthermore, the cost of switching brands is negligible.
                Companies continually come up with new products and designs to
                match the buyers’ demands. Costa, for instance, partnered with
                Nestle to come up with a new specialty chocolate and caramel
                muffin that brought curiosity among buyers.
              </p>
              <strong>Supplier Power</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The supplier bargaining power in the coffee industry is low. As
                mentioned earlier, the companies are powerful while the
                suppliers are many hence placing the companies in a dominant
                position to choose their suppliers. Furthermore, most of the
                companies produce their raw materials: the coffee beans. The
                firms mainly derive their power from their sales level that
                makes suppliers want to earn contracts from them to earn the
                benefits of economies of scale.
              </p>
              <strong>Threat of New Entrants</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The threat of new arrivals is high in the coffee industry due to
                the limited number of barriers to entry. It is not capital
                intensive since one can begin with small establishments and
                build on from them. Furthermore, buyers can easily switch to
                newer brands, especially if they come with better offers. The
                necessary skills to enter into the market are easily attainable
                through practice which makes easier for new entrants (Mighty,
                2017). The incessant growth in the industry over the years also
                makes the industry attractive to investors. However, some
                companies have such as Starbucks still manage to maintain most
                of their market share due to the strength of their branding.
                Costa Coffee has a strong branding in the UK which has enabled
                it to preserve majority of its market share. It is a different
                story, however, worldwide.
              </p>
              <strong> Threat of Substitutes</strong>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The threat of substitutes in the industry is high due to the
                presence of many alternative products that offer competition.
                Tea has grown to be a major substitute for coffee in many
                regions. In many countries currently, tea is the main beverage
                with coffee falling down the pecking order to be an occasional
                beverage. Besides other drinks, different coffee brands have
                also competed against each other over the years. The key to
                coping with the threat for the companies has often been
                branding.
              </p>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The SWOT analysis of Costa Coffee indicates that the firm has a
                well-established enterprise. The company has strengths that
                overweight the weaknesses. Its link to the giant company,
                Coca-Cola is a great stepping stone to achieving more success.
                The firm can easily improve its mechanization and efficiency due
                to the high level of innovation in the Coca-Cola Company.
                However, the firm has limited its expansion to only a few
                regions. Furthermore, the prices of their products are quite and
                customers continue to raise questions over the same in the
                reviews. Hence, not all classes get access to their products.
                Being that the company prides its products as being luxurious,
                it remains to be seen if it will consider making adjustments.
                The opportunities result mainly from the weaknesses and they
                present a chance for exploitation and improvement. One niche the
                company should consider covering is that of expansion. Finally,
                coming up with strategies to cope with the threats will be
                instrumental in enhancing the company’s position. The company
                should consider spending more on advertising to deal with its
                recently dropping brand value.

                Porter’s Five Forces Analysis of the industry gives a picture on
                the external forces that affect Costa Coffee and its position in
                the industry. The industry is competitive and Costa needs to
                find new strategies to be more competitive, especially in the
                global market. Partnerships and collaborations could be the
                first step towards improving their status. The threat of new
                entrants is one that needs more attention due to the limited
                barriers to entry in the industry. There is a need to develop
                cost advantages to try and fend off new competitors.

                      Restaurant Environment
                    </strong>
                    After going through the US fast-food industry, I have gained
                    a different insight into the environmental factors that
                    impact their operations. McDonald’s is by far the most
                    established industry with restaurants in several regions
                    within and outside the United States. Looking at the
                    performance of individual restaurants, it is clear that
                    their location is key to their productivity. Hence, even
                    though the company has branches in many regions, it has on
                    many occasions had to deal with issues not planned for. For
                    instance, political unrest in some areas often leads to
                    disruption of operations. Porter’s Five Forces still point
                    to location as a key factor in the industry. Competitive
                    rivalry is extremely high in the industry and as a result
                    some commentators have labelled the industry
                    hypercompetitive. McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s are
                    the main players and form an oligopolistic market. However,
                    the nature of competition has made them besides improving
                    their brands, to look for the most convenient locations.
                    Looking at threats of new entrants, they are quite high.
                    However, the brands have economies of scale and again, have
                    all the best locations occupied. Supplier and buyer power
                    are both low. However, substitute products are certainly a
                    problem. Like most problems in the environment, the key
                    solution in this industry is convenience location with
                    others like attractive branding coming second

              is an effective framework of analyzing an organization’s position.
              Škoda is a vehicle manufacturing firm that utilized the framework
              successfully and was able to survive in the competitive industry.
              Whereas I would advise usage of the framework, it is not an
              independent model but requires others to complement it. It does
              not cater for ambiguities like in the case study where Škoda
              initially made cheap but rather old-fashioned vehicles. The cost
              factor is a strength while the age is a weakness. The model was,
              however, effective in addressing the issues the company faced. For
              one, their products stopped getting belittled. Secondly, SWOT
              analysis enabled Škoda to spot an opportunity to promote not only
              their product, but also the driving experience. Finally, Škoda
              could easily respond to the threat of having to abide by
              environmental regulations by putting up measures that ensured
              environmental friendliness. In summation, therefore, SWOT analysis
              is an effective strategy that if used alongside others like
              Porter’s Five Forces analysis can be beneficial. 2. Case Study:
              Intel’s Theory of the Business Most organizations today when faced
              with barriers simply look for ways to improve or simply the “how.”
              Unfortunately that does not always provide the solution and Intel
              learnt this the hard way in the late 20th century. Insistence on
              pursuing the same activities differently has been a cause for
              failure. The theory of the business advocates for constant
              revision of the objectives. To put it simply, once a firm achieves
              its strategic objectives, it should consider doing something new
              rather than relaxing and waiting for returns. There is a price to
              pay but it is nothing compared to the risks of remaining rigid.
              Initially, Intel dealt in memory chips. The invention was
              groundbreaking and gave the company enormous profits. However,
              soon enough new firms, most of them Japanese, began producing
              memory chips that were cheaper and improved. The management of
              Intel sat back thinking they could innovate their way out of the
              challenge. The resultant nosedive in revenue was historic and made
              the managers ask the question that mattered: what to do rather
              than how. That marked their shift from memory chips to
              microprocessors and the price they had to pay was huge as many
              employees lost their jobs. The move, however, was a revelation as
              the growth of the computer market strengthened the brand
              significantly. 3. Case Study: Dollar Shave Club: Disrupting the
              Competition for One Dollar Dubin showed the highest level of
              competitive awareness when he launched Dollar Shave Club. Prior to
              the launch, Gillette ruled the male grooming market and
              continually produced newer and fancier products to improve its
              market position. However, like the inkjet printers that had ink
              cartridges’ prices almost exceeding the printers’ the razors were
              expensive. Dubin spotted a niche and immediately exploited it,
              forming the Dollar Shave Club. Dollar Shave Club provided
              customers with a blade handle and razors followed by replacement
              razors according to a customer’s subscription. Dollar Shave Club
              managed to compete with the powerful Gillette and in the end, it
              made a lot of profits resulting in a take-over by Unilever. The
              difference in the practices of Gillette and Dollar Shave Club are
              evident; the former made assumptions about customer preferences
              while the latter provided the customers with exactly what they
              ordered. Even though the competition became unfavorable in the
              end, Gillette had learnt something new. 4. Case Study: Throw Out
              the Knitting and Stick to Vertical Integration Apple and Tesla are
              among the most successful companies in the world and among the
              leading in their industries. The case study cites vertical
              integration as the reason behind their enormous success. Vertical
              integration, according to the article, is a strategy companies use
              to control their suppliers and their distributors so as to
              increase their power in the market and secure their supplies. When
              a company moves upwards, it reduces the power of the suppliers
              while a downward movement reduces the power of the distributors by
              moving closer to the consumers. It stands on the popular saying,
              “if you want something done well, do it yourself. Apple applies
              the strategy effectively by designing its own chips and writing
              its software and by running its own retail shops. Tesla, on the
              other hand, makes 80% of its cars and sells directly to consumers,
              eliminating middlemen. Vertical integration has many benefits that
              the case study highlights. Some of them include establishing good
              customer relationships, speeding up the chain of distribution, and
              simplicity. Furthermore, consumers have more faith dealing with a
              company directly due to the availability of reliable feedback. 5.
              Case Study: Inditex’s International Reach Inditex is the largest
              fashion retailer in the world and continues to soar higher despite
              the competition from other companies like H {"&"} M Hennes and
              Mauritz of Sweden. The company sells in every region in the world
              and continues to grow its markets. Inditex has a great business
              strategy that has ensured its success. Firstly, the company does
              not manufacture all the products from a central location for
              distribution. The logic behind it is that by the time the
              distribution gets to some regions, the clothes would probably
              already lost the fashion taste. Secondly, the company takes into
              consideration the culture of a place and makes matching designs.
              For instance, Germans prefer sporty clothes while Russians fancy
              pencil skirts with high heels; that is exactly what they get.
              Another admirable thing about the company is the lack of
              advertisement. In place of advertisements, the company updates its
              website regularly and change the look of the stores from time to
              time. Advertisements can be slow and with the fast changing trends
              and fashions, they can be inappropriate for such businesses.

                The United States has, for a long time, enjoyed dominance in the
                global economy and politics. Despite the idolization she gets
                from many states, she has her internal inconsistencies and
                challenges. One area where the United States is currently facing
                discrepancies is in her economic and social state. Social and
                economic disparities result from several issues. Some of the
                problems are either purely social or economic, while some have
                economic and social aspects. Some of the prevalent social issues
                in the United States are hate crimes, drug addiction, and media
                propaganda. Hate crimes result from other social problems such
                as sexual orientation, racism, religious differences, and
                disabilities. Economic issues, on the other hand, are more
                pronounced and occur both internally and externally. The major
                internal issue is the continually widening gap between the
                wealthy and the poor. It is a problem that does not show any
                likelihood of reducing. An external economic issue facing the
                United States is the growth of other rising powers such as
                China, India, Russia, and Brazil. They have successfully managed
                to reduce the global output of the United States in recent years
                to a worrying level. Other issues like immigration affect the
                nation both economically and socially. All the issues mentioned
                above have proven to be problems worth addressing. While some
                have solutions, some are only debatable but do not necessarily
                need solving. For instance, hate crimes are manageable through
                increasing police patrols and surveillance (even though it has
                brought congestion in the prisons). On the other hand, a social
                issue like same-sex marriage is not something solvable. Instead,
                it has become a topic of discussion through the media and in
                religious groups. The social and economic inconsistencies in the
                United States are not a new issue, having been seen in Medieval
                Europe before the 16th century. This article will compare the
                problems experienced in the United States with those in the
                early, high, and late Medieval Ages.

                The Early Medieval Period began in the 5th century and lasted
                roughly to the 10th century. The first most significant
                development in Europe at the time occurred in the Carolingian
                Empire, under Charlemagne, the king of Franks. This period was
                between 768 and 814, a period that saw the empire rise to
                dominance in Europe. Charlemagne assumed the throne of the
                Frankish kingdom after the death of his father. He immediately
                began expanding the territory, conquering many places in the
                process. As a result, he got branded “Charles the Great.”
                However, his move to help Pope Leo III quell the Romans'
                rebellion saw him anointed with oil by the pope. Hence, he
                became both a Germanic king and a Roman Emperor. He incorporated
                Christianity into his lengthy rule, a move that united the
                people . One particular trait that made Charlemagne a popular
                leader was his generosity. He often distributed food aid to the
                poor both within the empire and beyond to places like Egypt. He
                gained popularity with other emperors and kings, such as the
                Byzantine Emperor, who saw him as a threat to their territories.
                However, despite his many achievements, his rule also had a
                number of social and economic issues.

                Society then, like today, had a wide gap between the poor and
                the rich. The staple food to all the people was bread.
                Furthermore, alcohol was a regularly consumed commodity, and
                taverns were all over the place. Hence, the kingdom was rife
                with gluttony, which is comparable to the worrying trends of
                obesity in America today. However, the consumption of food and
                wine varied according to social classes. The affluent in society
                had more options; they ate pork frequently alongside the typical
                staple food – bread. Nevertheless, they drank limitlessly since
                resources to them were unlimited. The kingdom also had scarce
                financial resources since taxation had not yet come into the
                picture. Hence, all the nobles depended on the royal estates for
                their upkeep. However, the social problems remained under
                control because of the church’s influence over the leadership of
                the empire. Even though there were instances of gay
                relationships, the church simply condemned the act, but it never
                became a contentious issue. Furthermore, polygamy was illegal.
                Hence, people could only marry one wife and have a nuclear
                family, separated from many relations .

                The High Medieval Period began in 1000, lasting till around
                1200. It is a period that saw the rise of great kingdoms and an
                increase in the church's power. The Frankish kingdom after the
                death of Charlemagne became split into three, the west forming
                the French kingdom, the east Germany, and the middle, which was
                southwards, becoming Italy. Invasions by the Vikings, Magyars,
                and Muslims contributed to the decline of the kingdom. The High
                Medieval Age recorded a significant population increase never
                seen before in the history of Europe. The increase resulted from
                immigration and slavery. Furthermore, it was a period that
                marked the beginning of urbanization and rural-urban migration
                in most parts of the continent.

                Like the preceding period, the major social problem which also
                had an economic element was class differentiation. Landowners
                were mostly nobles, and lords and peasants worked on their farms
                to allow them the freedom to exercise their duties. The
                invention of plows did nothing to ease the peasants' burden
                since the demand for food was on the increase in the urban
                areas. The peasants, therefore, had to work harder, especially
                during the harvest seasons. The women had a greater
                responsibility than men. Apart from raising children, they also
                worked alongside the men in the fields. Hence, peasant marriages
                were nothing more than "economic partnerships." The only
                improvement from the Early Middle Age was in terms of food
                availability. Food was abundant and nutritious for both the
                peasants and the lords. Alcohol was also a social problem in
                this period and accounted for most of the accidental deaths. The
                peasants used an alcoholic drink made from grains called ale
                while the affluent class drank wine. A significant development
                in this period was the inception of schooling and particularly
                universities. However, it only served to widen the gap between
                the different social and economic classes since most peasants
                could not afford it.

                marked a time rife with war. During this time, England began the
                Hundred Years' War with France, a war that went on for more than
                a century. Furthermore, a plague known as the Black Plague
                killed many people during the same period, affecting the
                continent's economic, social, and political stability . The
                cause of the plague remained mysterious though several theories
                attempted to explain it.

                Like the previous ages, this period was rife with class
                differentiation. However, with the increased literacy levels,
                there were protests from peasants over their treatment. The
                protests, coupled with the reduced population due to the plague,
                placed the continent in a terrible economic state. The
                population was almost half of the original after the pandemic,
                and people struggled to reestablish businesses from scratch. War
                and religious rivalry was another contributor to economic
                constraints. However, like the previous ages, alcohol
                consumption remained to be a prominent social problem.

                The Middle Ages in Europe, as seen above, had almost similar
                social and economic problems like the current society in the
                United States. Alcohol and its other associated products remain
                prevalent in contemporary society, just like in Medieval Europe.
                Moreover, class differentiation has not gotten any better
                despite the current economy being more robust and capable. In
                the United States, some regions have higher populations of
                wealthy people compared to others. The inequality is even worse
                compared to Medieval Europe. The national economy may be among
                the strongest in the world, but its significant boosters are the
                extremely wealthy . Transferring some of the rich people to the
                regions with lower economies will consequently improve the
                economy of the place. However, it will do nothing to improve the
                situation of the individuals living in the area. As a result,
                the cost of living rises at the standard of the rich, making the
                poor struggle all the more . In short, the gap is widening all
                the more.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, lessons from Medieval Europe can help provide a remedy
                to the situation. The church and the authorities in the Middle
                Ages worked hand-in-hand to shape society. It, therefore, became
                more comfortable to control some aspects of society. However,
                currently, the church and the government seem to be fighting to
                show their dominance. Each views the other as a threat, and
                hence, society can only watch the fight from a distance or take
                sides. If the two sides were to work together again, the
                community's social inconsistencies would become significantly
                reduced.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                One thing that was common in the Medieval Age was war. The wars
                were a result of the different kingdoms' struggles to be the
                dominant force in Europe. Unfortunately, the same mistake is
                bound to reoccur as several powers are on the rise in what seems
                to be economic warfare. The only possible result of this rivalry
                is poor international relations and, in the worst-case scenario,
                a physical war. Countries must try to avoid unnecessary
                competitions that end up affecting social interactions and
                economies. The best action to take is to form trade alliances
                that will instead be beneficial to countries and continents in
                general.

                In conclusion, all the social and economic problems in the
                current society are not new. They have only risen to a
                sophisticated level due to technological advancements and the
                resultant changes. Alcohol, for instance, is not a new
                development, as seen in the discussion above. The only
                difference is that currently, alcoholic drinks are classified
                and measured in terms of their contents. Nevertheless, they are
                more dangerous and addictive compared to the drinks in the past.
                However, with a joint effort, it is possible to find solutions
                to most of the social problems affecting the current community.

                Incentives are positive influence that are given to individual
                in a company or organization with an intention of motivating
                them to increase their performance. Financial incentives
                therefore, are incentives that can be measured in monetary form.
                Employees or workers in a given firm or industry as whole need
                to be motivated and encouraged to keep acting in a predetermined
                desired way (Jenkins, 1998). Motivation of employees involves
                actions of inciting or inducing employees to perform task better
                and with ease. It is a way of keeping the employees excited
                about working hard and better (Mason and Watts,2009) . Companies
                need to come up with strategies of keeping employees motivated
                and financial incentives is one of those wants.

                on the total output and do not really reflect quality of

                rate increase due to the high risk exposure to the virus. This
                pay was meant to motivate the employees to continue working

                I agree that finance incentives are the best way to motivate
                employees to a lesser extent. Based on the two given cases, the
                impact of the given incentives to the employee’s performance is
                generally minimal and is not directly connected to the provided
                incentives. Some of the financial incentives offered by the
                companies are very minimal and at most very insignificant to
                influence the employee general performance. Companies such as
                Amazon offer financial incentives as a way of just shielding the
                employees from potential risks and not necessarily to keep them
                motivated (Wingfield & Abelson,2018) . Such actions do not
                reflect the real purpose of the incentives.

                This incentives on the other hand could keep the employees
                encouraged to keep working considering the long term benefits
                that they derive from the incentives. Some financial incentives
                on having a saving plan for retirement, provides the employees
                with an assurance of having a continued good life even after
                they are out of their jobs. This may therefore be a motivation
                for employees.

                is relevant to our topic as it highlights the positive impact
                caused by AI on work in China.

                Automation and advancement in technology can sometimes cause a
                threat to the human labor force. (Crittenden et al., 2019
                pp.191-203) suggest that technology has led to the displacement
                of human labor among the East Asia nations. Also, many scholars
                are still conducting studies to support the occurrence of
                technologically prompted unemployment. According to the authors,
                displacement of employees signifies improved productivity which
                ensures reduced labor requirements and wages in some sections.
                For instance, international trade in China has been associated
                with job displacement. However, China's competition can only
                show a fourth of manufacturing reduction as experienced in the
                2000s. Some technologies, such as machine learning to replace
                specific tasks that humans previously performed, have been the
                primary concern of many employees in China.

                The advancement in technology has attributed to a mismatch
                between the workforce's available capabilities and the new
                expertise. According to the research conducted by (Capozza &
                Divella 2019 p 74 1-757), emergence of new technologies in Japan
                has caused a significant skills gap in the country. The authors
                add that concept has caused millions of jobs to be unattended
                due to a insufficient skilled workforce. However, the authors
                indicate a need for a comprehensive analysis of the skill gap to
                validate this aspect of skills among the labor force and the job
                opportunities available. Therefore, the effect of technology on
                work should be considered continuous hence is essential to
                understand the process at specific times of advancement.
