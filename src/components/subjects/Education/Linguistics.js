              Individual differences have been a subject of research in second
              language studies for a long time due to the variations in
              acquisition success. While every human being in a complete society
              acquires a first language to a level of expertise, second language
              acquisition often differs greatly between people. As a result,
              psychologist have spent a lot of time studying individual
              differences. According to Dörnyei (2014), psychologists consider
              them distractions to their study of the general principles of the
              human mind. Without individual differences, it would be much
              easier coming up with valid deductions about the human mind and
              species (Dörnyei, 2014). Individual differences, therefore, form
              the primary distinction between social and natural sciences. It is
              evident in experiments on human cells and human behaviour; the
              former will always have identical results whereas the latter will
              differ even amongst identical twins (Dörnyei, 2014).

              Identical differences are not hard to define. From the
              nomenclature, it refers to character traits unique to individuals
              and that show how each differs from the other. The definition,
              however, needs narrowing since it comprises everything making
              someone stand out including their dressing and eye colour.
              According to De Raad (2000), the disparities in question should
              show permanency over time. Dörnyei (2014) gives a more fitting
              definition of individual differences: “dimensions of enduring
              personal characteristics assumed to apply to everybody and on
              which people differ by degree.” That said, therefore, there are
              numerous individual difference constructs. Some common examples
              are age, gender, aptitude, personality, attitude and motivation.

              One mistake made in most language classroom is applying teaching
              methodologies that generalise learners. Most of the methods are
              teacher centred and treat the entire classroom as a homogenous
              entity, overlooking what individual learners bring to the table
              (Hall, 2011). Others choose to focus on learning processes common
              to all learners. However, it has become evident that learners
              differ in their language acquisition capabilities. One proof is
              the category of learners termed as “good language learners.”
              Furthermore, there have been claims by some scholars over one
              gender being generally better at acquiring second languages. Those
              are not the only factors as research has proven that other
              elements such as age, motivation and personality have significant
              influences on second language acquisition. These attributes are
              what make learners complement the teachers’ efforts but the
              effectiveness of the contribution depends on the enhancement of
              their individual characteristics (Allwright & Hanks, 2009).
              According to Harmer (2007), the realisation that a classroom is
              not a unified whole is the first step in responding to students
              individually. This article will specifically look at age and how
              it influences second language acquisition, with relevant examples.
            </p>
            <p>
              The neurologist Eric Lenneberg (1967) takes credit for beginning
              the discussion of the relationship between age and second language
              acquisition. He hypothesised that children have an inborn
              inclination to acquire language, governed by biological factors.
              One of the primary influencers is a biological clock that
              restricts the period within which language acquisition needs to
              take place. This period roughly runs between 2 years and the
              beginning of puberty. During this period, the brain has cerebral
              plasticity and hence, language acquisition is natural.
              Furthermore, language is evenly spread in the brain across both
              hemispheres. At puberty, the brain hemispheres begin specialising
              in specific activities and this limits language acquisition.
              Furthermore, the plasticity disappears and the brain becomes rigid
              (Lenneberg, 1967). Lenneberg, however, does not rule out the
              possibility of language acquisition happening past puberty.
              However, he claims that the reflex acquisition as a result of
              exposure to a language disappears. Hence, even though an adult may
              acquire a second language, they will find it difficult acquiring
              the language accent.

              {" "}
              It has always been a popular belief in many regions that younger
              ages are more appropriate for second language learning. According
              to ‘anecdote and assumption’ as Cohen (2004) terms it, children
              have better success in language learning compared to adults. There
              are many practical examples of the same in the population. As a
              result, in many regions in the world, younger and younger children
              are getting introduced to language teaching (Hall, 2011). There is
              extensive research in support of the claim. Hu (2016) notes that
              there is a critical period where children show an advantage over
              adults in second language acquisition. The claim is a development
              on the hypothesis by Penfield and Roberts (2014) that competence
              declines with increasing age of exposure. Ellis (2015), on the
              other hand, claims that there is a certain period when language
              acquisition is more efficient. When one outgrows the period, the
              brain can no longer handle the process effectively. Lenneberg
              (1967) introduced the term ‘lateralisation.’ He used it to
              describe the puberty stage characterized by coupling of
              localisation of language processing in the left hemisphere with
              biological change in the body. Hence, children remain to have an
              advantage over both adolescents and adults. However, recently,
              there studies that refute the claim. Hall (2011) believes that
              even though age affects second language learning, the nature of
              the influence is not as popular belief has it. This is because
              there is inconsistency in evidence favouring the upper hand that
              younger learners have over their older counterparts in second
              language acquisition (Larsen-Freeman, 2001). Hence, it brought a
              lot of further questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Age does not affect all aspects of second language learning –
              phonology, syntax, lexical – in the same way. There is, however,
              not much clarity in all the aspects of second language learning.
              Pronunciation is one of the commonly cited example where younger
              learners seem to excel. Both Larsen-Freeman (2001) and Ortega
              (2009) believe that learners who begin to acquire a second
              language before the age of puberty achieve better success than
              those who begin after. However, the same does not apply to
              vocabulary and grammar acquisition of the second language. Older
              children have better vocabulary retention capabilities compared to
              younger ones and it gets better with age (Brown, 2007: Cook,
              2008). There is, however, no significant impact of age on grammar
              acquisition (Larsen-Freeman, 2001; Stern, 1983). From the
              foregoing evidence, therefore, it is difficult to point out an
              appropriate age for second language acquisition.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Another way in which age influences second language acquisition is
              the learning methods of adults and children. Adults have better
              cognitive capabilities as compared to children and as such, they
              can learn in more abstract ways (Hall, 2011). Hence, adults tend
              to excel in formal settings that involve application of logic,
              formulas or mapping of language concepts into specific contexts.
              This is because they have cognitive maturity and also experience
              in the language system having already achieved proficiency in the
              first language. Hence, they can easily acquire morphological,
              syntactical and phonological rules of the second language as
              compared to children. However, younger children happen to catch up
              quickly to gain proficiency in the same after a while (Ortega,
              2009). On the other hand, younger children excel more in informal
              settings with less constructions and analyses. This is why
              children seem to learn more efficiently by association and
              interaction as compared to adults. In general, children display a
              higher level of flexibility in both learning environments since
              they learn and adapt quickly even in areas they are not great.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Even though it is difficult to point out the most appropriate age
              for learning a language, the odds are in favour of the younger
              learners. However, it remains to be a matter of choice based on
              the period required to acquire the language. If the learning is
              likely to take a long time, then it becomes more appropriate for
              younger learners (Cook, 2008). Younger children have flexibility
              to changes and are more willing to learn through trial and error
              unlike adults who would be too careful not to make mistakes.
              Eventually, the younger learners would become much better speakers
              (Cook, 2008). On the other hand, if the learning is likely to take
              a short time, it becomes logical to start older children or
              adults. They have the ability to achieve higher second language
              competencies within a short time since they apply their experience
              with other languages they have encountered to the new language. It
              is, however, important to note that the above recommendations do
              not have to apply to all individuals. There will always be
              exceptions; for instance, not all adults will show a higher
              vocabulary retention capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The impact of age difference is usually evident even in classroom
              situations. I have classroom experiences with learners of
              different ages and the results were always generally in clusters
              according to age. Firstly, there is a difference in acquisition of
              phonological skills. Most of the younger learners would acquire a
              close to native accent in the second language. This is proof that
              younger learners are better in mastering pronunciations compared
              to their older counterparts. However, the older ones would
              outperform the young ones in written assessments. Furthermore, the
              older learners mostly proved to be better in the syntactic level.
              The reason for the above is as earlier mentioned: adults have
              better chances of grasping rules in the second language as
              compared to children. This is because adults have a better
              cognitive maturity than children.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Several other studies have found similar results where children
              and adults are concerned (Bista, 2008; Singleton, 1989). Dunkel
              and Pillet (in Singleton, 1989), for instance, investigated the
              level of competence and performance in French elementary school
              pupils and university students starting to learn French. The
              outcome showed that the elementary school pupils were better in
              pronunciation than the university students; they had a native-like
              accent that the university students did not. However, in both
              aural and written tests, the university students proved to be
              better (Bista, 2008). Singleton (1989) also reports a study by
              Fathman and Precup on children and adults in a formal setting in
              Mexico. The study sampled 20 children and 20 adults and tested
              their proficiency in English language. The outcome, like the
              former, pointed to children doing better in pronunciation while
              the adults outperformed them in syntax. This further proves the
              superiority of adults in formal settings and the flexibility of
              children to changes. According to Lenneberg (1967), the reason
              adults cannot easily acquire foreign accents is because their
              brains the flexibility that younger people’s still have.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              From the results of the studies mentioned above, we can make
              conclusions about age as a factor in second language acquisition.
              Firstly, where time and exposure is constant for all groups,
              adults move faster through initial stages of morphological and
              syntactic progress (Bista, 2008). They rely on their better
              cognitive capabilities and first language experiences. Secondly,
              older children will acquire a second language faster than younger
              children, again with time and exposure constant (Krashen, 1979).
              However, the older children would have a slower rate of
              improvement and would continually fall behind while the younger
              ones improved rapidly. Thirdly, learners who begin natural
              exposure to a second language during their childhood achieve
              higher competency and performance levels than those beginning as
              adults (Singleton, 1989). Fourthly, naturalistic or informal
              learning settings favour and bring the best out of younger
              learners since they rarely involve analytical reasoning techniques
              (Hall, 2011: Cook, 2008). On the other hand, adults find formal
              settings more appropriate to their language acquisition.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              In conclusion, when looking at age as a factor affecting second
              language acquisition, the consideration is not just on the when,
              but also the how. That is to say, it is not just about the
              appropriate age of learning a language, but also the most suitable
              means of learning for particular age groups. However, despite all
              the claims mentioned above, there are exceptions to all the
              patterns and all age-groups. For instance, starting learning early
              and learning in naturalistic settings will not always guarantee
              success to all young learners. Similarly, not all adults excel in
              formal settings and neither do all retain vocabulary effectively.
              There are additional factors that may affect an individual’s
              second language acquisition such as aptitude and attitude.
              Cumulatively, all the factors make up individual differences and
              are unique to every learner. It is upon teachers, therefore, to
              identify the differences so as to know the most effective ways to
              handle every individual.

            <p>
              {" "}
              Sixteen year old learners are already past puberty and, therefore,
              their minds are more cognitively mature. Adjectives and adverbs
              are grammatical topics and hence, should be pretty easy for them
              to grasp. This is because they can apply grammatical rules of
              their first languages easily to the second language. All languages
              have their unique patterns of subject, verb, object, determiner,
              complement and adjuncts. The only challenge, therefore, would be
              to identify the elements in the second language and the order in
              which they appear. As for their functions, they will always be
              similar to the first language. Hence, the students, being older
              and with better reasoning skills, can easily understand grammar in
              the second language. The important thing in the topic would be to
              identify the positioning of adverbs and adjectives in sentences
              and their respective roles. In teaching the group, however, there
              are several learner factors that I would take into consideration
              so as to be effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Firstly, it would be important to assess the aptitude of the
              learners. Aptitude refers to the speed of language learning
              (Ranta, 2008). All learners have the ability to master content but
              they do so at varying speeds (Johnson, 2008). Furthermore, some
              learners may be fast in mastering phonetics while some are better
              with semantics and yet others in syntax among other elements.
              Knowing the general speed of the learners will enable me to move
              at a pace that will be favourable to even the slowest learner in
              the classroom. Hence, I will ensure that where the others move
              faster, I concentrate on their progress. The best way to determine
              their aptitude would be through the use of sentence starters and
              letting students finish them. After helping them through a few,
              they should be able to do the rest and provide a chance for
              assessing their abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Secondly, knowing the cultural background of the learners would be
              helpful in planning the lesson. Culture plays a key role in the
              learners’ activities in the classroom and consequently, can bring
              about differences in performance. For instance, culture has for a
              long time shaped the behaviour of the different gender groups.
              Boys are in most cases more vocal than girls in class but still
              girls manage to outwit them in language performance. In the United
              Kingdom, for example, and many other regions in the world, girls
              are the better performers in language. The cause is often cultural
              practices and social norms which from an early age encourage girls
              to develop better social interaction skills and consequently
              learning strategies (Hall, 2011). The practices pass on through
              generations and get incited through societal pressures. Women for
              instance in most societies consider languages an important aspect
              of future lives and hence, they have better learning strategies
              than men. Knowing their cultural and social backgrounds would not
              be hard since their teacher would have their records. I would have
              to go through their profiles prior to the lesson to know the kind
              of students I have to deal with.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Finally, the last consideration would be motivation. Motivation
              alongside aptitude, are very important aspects of language
              learning that without which it would be difficult to master a
              second language. Motivation is a state of emotional and cognitive
              arousal to do something and which results in a continual effort to
              do the activity (Hall, 2011). Motivation is key towards achieving
              short-term and long-term objectives and any decrease would
              certainly affect performance. It would be important to know
              whether the learners are motivated and if so, where they derive
              their motivation from: whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic.
              Intrinsic motivation comes from within an individual and is a
              result of their interest or passion in doing something. Extrinsic
              motivation comes from without and could be from the environment,
              from a desire to achieve a reward or to avoid punishment. If the
              motivation is intrinsic, the learners would likely have read ahead
              of the teacher. However, if it is extrinsic, it would mean the
              students are relying solely on outside motivation to work. Hence,
              they would most likely be waiting for assessments to answer so as
              to derive some benefits from it. Knowing their source of
              motivation would be beneficial in planning the lesson. For
              instance, if it is extrinsic, then I would have to find some
              reinforcements to capture their interests.

              {" "}
              Lesson activities are important because they determine the success
              of a lesson. A classroom that is wholly dependent on teacher
              activities would not have the same outcome compared to a learner
              centred one or one that finds balance between the two. In planning
              for the lesson, I would have to prepare classroom activities that
              would involve the learners and keep them attentive. Furthermore,
              the activities should be all inclusive to avoid leaving some
              learners behind. Therefore, taking all the above-mentioned factors
              into consideration, I would come up with the following classroom
              activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Firstly, I will take time to teach myself the content basing on
              their last work. Growing up speaking a language does not guarantee
              proficiency in the language and it is always necessary to prepare
              adequately. Furthermore, some intrinsically motivated students
              might want to consult on a topic ahead and without sufficient
              preparation, they may lose confidence in a teacher. Even though
              grammar has a lot of rules, it also has exceptions to every rule.
              In differentiating adverbs from adjectives for instance, a teacher
              may tell students that adverbs generally end with the suffix -ly.
              Examples may include slowly, skilfully, swiftly and carefully.
              However, not all adverbs contain the suffix as there are numerous
              exceptions such as fast, yesterday, quite and often. Hence,
              without adequate preparation, teachers can easily find themselves
              at the mercy of exceptions to rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Secondly, to make the learning fun, I will incorporate games.
              Preferably, the games should be after the set induction. Games are
              not only for children for contrary to popular opinion, adults
              enjoy them too. Adults generally have a difficult time learning
              second languages than children due to the reduced curiosity
              levels. Since it is a grammar lesson, it can be especially tiring
              and off putting considering the rules one has to master. Games,
              therefore, offer learners an alternative way to learn that does
              not involve superficially having to grasp the rules. Furthermore,
              learning through gaming aids in memorising the content more easily
              than the traditional lecturing means. Besides boosting memory,
              games serve other important functions in the classroom. Firstly,
              they encourage cooperation among the learners. Most games require
              pairing or teaming up and encourage the students to work together.
              Secondly, they shake things up and reduce monotony of learning.
              Finally, they bring the spirit of competition to the classroom.
              Learners always prepare themselves for competitions, aiming for
              recognition. An appropriate game for the adverbs and adjectives
              topic would be blackboard race where learners would compete
              identifying adverbs and adjectives in groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The third activity would be inductive teaching exercises.
              Inductive teaching method entails letting students infer grammar
              rules on their own through completing some tasks. It would be more
              effective considering the learners are grown up and can easily
              apply reasoning to understand certain concepts. A perfect way to
              handle adverbs and adjectives would be to provide a variety of
              similar sentences with different adverbs and adjectives. The
              learners would then try and explain the value they play in the
              sentences. Beginning with adjectives, the following sentences can
              be provided to the learners: She has a beautiful toy She is a huge
              toy She has a pink toy She has a rectangular toy From the above
              sentences, students can easily deduce the function of adjectives
              in sentences. All the underlined words – adjectives – have one
              thing in common, that is, describing the nature of the toy. Since
              the toy is a noun, learners would have to reason that adjectives
              describe nouns in sentences.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The same is also possible with adverbs. The following sentences
              could be used for inductive teaching exercises on adverbs. <br />
              She travels tomorrow
              <br />
              She travels fast
              <br />
              She travels extremely fast
              <br />
              She is very beautiful
              <br />
              The sentences make it easier to deduce the role adverbs play in
              sentences and students can easily reason out the inferences. In
              the first two sentences, the underlined words describe the ‘how’
              and ‘when’ of the action. In the third, the first adverb describes
              the extent of the second adverb while the second adverb describes
              the action – traveling. In the last, the adverb describes the
              extent of the adjective beautiful. Hence, as long as the learners
              can identify the adverbs in sentences, they can easily deduce
              their functions. In the above examples, it would be evident that
              adverbs describe actions or verbs, other adverbs and adjectives.
              Therefore, differentiating between adverbs and adjectives becomes
              easier once their functions get known.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fourth teaching activity would be teaching the content in
              context: having specific activities for specific sections of the
              lesson. For the set induction, I would use sentence starters and
              let learners complete them. This would serve to introduce the
              topic of the day and give the learners a clue to set their minds
              working. Take the following sentences for instance: The boys ran
              ¬¬¬¬______ The _____ car is the fastest of all in that store
              Filling the blanks will be the first step towards defining adverbs
              and adjectives. The learners are likely to fill the blanks without
              knowing what they used. However, with a little guidance, they will
              be able not only to define them, but also to use them. As the
              lesson progresses, I will let the students work in small groups or
              in pairs to help each other understand. I will guide them where
              they miss the point and preferably refer their questions back to
              their colleagues who have a grasp. Finally, to test their
              understanding, the students can do a competitive activity as an
              ice-breaker to rekindle their interest in the topic. Grammar has
              never been easy to handle and can easily make learners lose focus,
              hence the need for activities that will maintain their attention.
              Finally, for closure, I will give assignments and references for
              further reading then briefly introduce the content of the next
              lesson.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Lastly, I would talk less and do more. I will instead let the
              lesson be student centred so as to give them confidence to learn
              and apply the concepts. For intermediate language students, less
              is more. Teachers should by all means fight the temptation to
              create long lessons. Keeping the lesson short and concrete would
              be more effective since it will ensure learners remember what they
              last learnt before going into something else. Furthermore,
              considering the complexity of grammar and its associated
              attitudes, it would be wiser to keep lessons short so as to
              maintain the attention of the learners. This will have a
              psychological effect on the learners as they would have a more
              positive outlook towards grammar. It also benefits me as the
              teacher since I will have enough time to ensure the content
              reaches all learners satisfactorily.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the learners to whom the above lesson planning
              concerns are past puberty stage. At this stage, their brains are
              no longer suited to informal settings as earlier mentioned in the
              first part of this paper. However, their brains are better
              developed and have better reasoning skills as compared to those
              below puberty stage. However, learners at this stage also have a
              challenge with interest levels. They do not have the curiosity to
              explore and learn that younger children have. Hence, maintaining
              their attention level requires more effort. This is why in the
              above plan there is a provision for grammar games. Adults just
              like children enjoy a challenge and a chance to compete against
              each other. Furthermore, since this is a stage where their brains
              have other specialised functions, they tend to have a mixture of
              other feelings and attitudes that affect their learning. It is for
              this reason that I would choose to keep the lesson short.
              Furthermore, by encouraging collaboration among the learners, it
              eases their attitudes towards both the teacher and the subject.{" "}

              Currently, people are living in an age where the world has been
              turned into a small space, commonly referred to as a global
              village (Michael Byram and Adelheid Hu 2013, xxxi) where
              interaction and mingling of people from different places have
              become the norm of the day. This interaction has brought about
              communication necessitation between these particular groups of
              individuals that were interacting. Since people from different
              backgrounds communicate in other languages, it has become
              necessary for people to grasp the various languages to facilitate
              smooth and continuous communication. The process of learning a
              foreign language is not an easy task. It comes with its advantages
              and disadvantages. It also has a lot of barriers to overcome for
              its success. It is common knowledge that learning a particular
              language would be easy if taught from a younger age. It might look
              like an easy thing from just the mention of how learning a foreign
              language or introducing a foreign language to young kids is easy,
              but practically, it is an uphill task from the word go. When
              introducing foreign language learning in an institution, you
              should consider many factors and put many resources in place. Help
              put in place may include research on a particular language,
              training teachers of a specific language, exchange programs, and
              encouragement of using a foreign language in various institutions.
              This undertaking also faces a lot of challenges. There is a need
              to employ qualified professionals to teach these languages.
              Rigidity to accept a change to learning a new language by
              learners. Existing cultural behaviors in a given setting and
              teaching methods also affect the teaching of a foreign language.
              Learning a foreign language at a younger age is therefore not a
              guarantee that one will fully grasp the taught language. A lot has
              to be considered.

              It is evident that for young learners to be in a position to get a
              full grasp of a new language, they need a professional to instruct
              and direct them in the right manner. It is, therefore, necessary
              that the government employ professionals with knowledge and skills
              to handle the same. Undertaking such an endeavor is not a cheap
              task. Training and hiring need a lot of money to be spent by the
              government. The government will therefore have to come up with a
              budget to handle the same with ease. They should also put people
              who are able and ready and can handle such activities with ease.
              School schedules also have to be readjusted to accommodate the
              same teachings into a particular institution's curriculum without
              altering with the smooth running of the normal school programs.

              The government can also provide more learning materials to
              facilitate their learning process and understanding of a given
              foreign language. The materials provided will go a long way in
              promoting and enhancing their understanding. The materials should
              also be enough for the given group of students. Enough reading
              materials will also ease the teachers’ delivery of information.

              People do make a very general assumption that all the young kids
              will be able to understand a particular foreign language once they
              are taught in class. Change is not something people get accustomed
              to with simple ease. It would even be a more formidable task
              considering it is being introduced to kids at a younger age. It,
              therefore, implies that they will have to readjust to accommodate
              the same into their academic life.

              When one is born, they are usually introduced to a language, and
              this forms part of their first language, the introduction of a new
              language to them will not be taken with open arms. Therefore, the
              kids being introduced to the same will have to readjust to this
              new normal, which will not be easy and will take a very long time.
              Some kids will take the unique experience with open arms, but for
              others, it will take getting used to, or they may fail to get a
              grasp of it. The difference in understanding has a simple
              explanation. People have different ways of reacting to new
              knowledge. Some who are fast learners will naturally get the
              presented content. Others who are interested in learning a
              particular language will get it quickly. A group of students with
              prejudice to one specific language will have a different opinion
              about it. They will feel like its being forced on them and this

              Every teacher has their ways of presenting ideas to the learners.
              Others have more appealing methods to the students, while others
              have strategies that do not facilitate the easy grasping of
              content. Young learners are not a comfortable lot to teach.
              Therefore, a teacher needs to be patient with their students to
              get a full grasp of a given content when presenting it. Using
              pictorials, songs, and games to teach young learners will make a
              lesson more appealing and involving for all the student. One will
              therefore find it easy to master a language through such methods
              of teaching. But some teachers prefer standing in front of
              students and teaching continuously without a lot of interaction
              with students. Continuous education without interaction presents a
              problem to the students as they will not fully concentrate in
              class as required. Less concentration means that the learning
              process will not be as successful as it was anticipated.

              It won't be easy to introduce a foreign language to a young kid in
              an individual setting. People in a particular environment may be
              accustomed to only a single language. Therefore, it will be hard
              for them to communicate with their kids in the new language being
              taught to them. It will therefore be hard for the kids to improve
              on language learning.

              Some people may also have prejudice towards some culture relating

              introduction of that specific language to be taught to their kids.
              The opposition will consequently cause a significant obstacle to
              its success. A kid's environment plays a significant role in their
              ability actually to understand a given foreign language.

              {" "}
              It is essential to undertake a lot of study before introducing a
              particular foreign language in a system. Young kids who are being
              taught this should be involved in the process, and their views
              given the utmost consideration. The research should look at a
              language structure. researchers should also understand a language
              to see if it can interfere with a given community's cultural
              values.

              The measure of language knowledge is one of more random language
              usage. Research has revealed that experience of language
              structures demonstrated on discrete-point tests does not guarantee
              communicative capacity. Further research has shown that the laws
              that learners are taught have no impact on their developing
              knowledge of the second language. (Moeller, Aleidine Kramer and
              Catalano, Theresa 2015, 328). With research findings, we are
              equipped with the knowledge needed to introduce and conduct a
              foreign language to young kids simply and with ease.

              Teachers who are engaged in teaching a particular foreign language

              necessary skills to impart knowledge and the know-how to young
              learners successfully. Teachers should be encouraged to use
              teaching methods that are more appealing to young learners. Use of
              say, dances, songs, and other engaging teaching styles are key
              teaching features that encourage learner's participation in the
              teaching process, and at the end of it all, they would have gained
              a lot. Which means a success to the teaching of the foreign
              language to kids.

              Therefore, the government of a particular country where a foreign

              the best out of those they decide to train.

              In response to the importance of providing students with
              opportunities to learn and practice the foreign language, the
              government should enable several curricular innovations
              implementation. (Moeller, Aleidine Kramer and Catalano, Theresa

              The government can also provide more learning materials to
              facilitate their learning process and understanding of a given
              foreign language. The materials will go a long way in easing their
              knowledge. The materials should be enough for the given group of

              As a result of studies and interactions that have extended the
              empirical and theoretical knowledge base about how students learn
              and acquire a foreign language, learning and teaching a foreign
              language have experienced a significant archetype change. Learning
              a foreign language has traditionally been regarded as a difficult
              task. The teaching took place through mimicry and cramming of
              words.

            <p>
              {" "}
              However, with exchange programs, students can interact with people
              who have spoken the particular language as their first language.
              This mere interaction acts as a significant boost to the kid's
              learning process, and they are encouraged and motivated to try
              hard and understand the particular language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Students find that even some cultures of those particular
              communities speaking languages they are learning relate to theirs.
              Therefore, they try as much as possible to match with them. The
              interaction will also motivate the young learners as it will
              encourage them, seeing that even other people easily communicate
              in that particular language{" "}

              Those in charge of institutions can put in place policies to
              ensure that a particular foreign language being taught is spoken.
              An institution can even introduce competitions that only allow
              those with the understanding of the foreign language to take part
              in those cannot be locked out and putting up prices for the best
              performers. Such competitions encourage learners to try their best
              to learn the same languages. The institutions can also introduce
              clubs that promotes the speaking of a particular foreign language
              being taught. They can also introduce days where that is the only
              language being spoken.

              . The government can also put in place motivation tokens for
              teachers who teach these languages. Such motivations go a long way
              in ensuring that they deliver at their full potential. When the
              teachers give their best, it is the students who will benefit, and
              this will go a long way in ensuring the success of this particular
              undertaking.

              Hon Tony Blair, former British prime minister, was once quoted
              saying, "Everyone knows that with languages, the earlier you
              start, the easier they are.” (The Rt Hon Tony Blair, 1999 – speech
              at the University of Oxford). From what he said, one can easily be
              misled to think that teaching a foreign language at an early stage
              is just a ride at the park, and it will be an instant success. We
              have seen that this is not the case. Foreign language learning and
              teaching is a whole process that comes with a lot of challenges
              and obstacles which have to be overcome. Therefore, the concerned
              stakeholders must come together and ensure that they put in place
              measures and policies that will help realize the dream of teaching
              a foreign language to young kids and having a higher success rate
              in them. It is always easy to tackle every problem if you work
              together as a team.
