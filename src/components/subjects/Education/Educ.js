              Federal laws and regulations that oversee special education have
              led to the development of a process to access special education.
              The reason for it is to provide children with disabilities free
              and appropriate education (FAPE), a right guaranteed in the
              Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Discussed
              below are some crucial information about the special education
              process.
            </p>
            <h1>Pre-referral and Referral </h1>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Once a child exhibits some problems in the classroom, it calls for
              pre-referral intervention. The pre-referral step aims to come up
              with and execute alternate schemes for children with difficulties
              before referring them for special education. In a way it serves as
              a deterrent measure against inappropriate special education
              referrals. It is conducted by a team that comprises the teacher,
              an administrator, guardian, guidance counsellor, and a general
              education teacher and any other party directly involved in the
              child’s learning. The problem the child has is brought on board by
              the general education teacher and the team then proceeds to come
              up with possible remedies. If the interventions fail to address
              the issue, then the child gets referred for evaluation to
              determine whether they are eligible for special education. The
              pre-referral team provides evidence to aid the later assessment
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The referral step follows up after the interventions in the
              general education classroom fail to help improve the child’s
              performance. Referral opens the door to determination of
              eligibility for special education. Referral can be done by the
              school staff: the counsellors, special education and general
              education teachers, or administrators, the child’s parents or
              guardians or any other person directly involved in the child’s
              education. The pre-referral team mentioned above is can also make
              a referral for determination of eligibility for special education.
              Once the referral is made, the school then seeks permission for
              the child’s parents or guardian(s) to begin the assessment
              process.
            </p>
            <h1>Assessment Process </h1>
            <p>
              {" "}
              After referral has been made, IDEA requires multiple
              non-discriminatory evaluations to be done to have an accurate
              picture of the child’s abilities compared to their peers. The
              process should not go beyond 60 days after referral. The process
              is conducted by a multidisciplinary team comprising individual
              members with appropriate professional skills in different areas.
              They may include medical doctors, therapists, psychometrists,
              general education instructors, special educators, and parents or
              guardians. The language of instruction in the tests is usually one
              the child is most competent at to ensure there is a high level of
              accuracy. Generally the tests measure intelligence,
              disability-specific problems, medical issues, and behavior. Common
              tests comprise individual intelligence tests, group intelligence
              tests, and skills evaluation.
            </p>
            <h1>Eligibility and Identification</h1>
            <p>
              {" "}
              This is the next step after completion of assessment. The same
              team that assessed the child meets 30 days after the evaluation to
              determine eligibility for special education. There are two
              conditions that must be met to qualify for special education which
              are: 1) the child has a disability as defined by IDEA that
              negatively impacts their educational performance, and 2) the child
              requires special education to benefit from education ("Special
              Education Referral Process - Project IDEAL", 2013). Where the
              identified problem does not necessarily impact the child’s
              education, the school has to find a way to assist the child.
            </p>
            <h1>Service Delivery Options</h1>
            <p>
              {" "}
              There are many ways in which children with disabilities can
              receive special education and in different settings. Whereas some
              can perform well in general education classrooms provided there is
              proper support, others need more intensive supports the classrooms
              cannot provide. Hence, depending on the needs of the learner,
              there are several service delivery options in special education
              suitable to specific types of students. Some of them are: regular
              class placement, resource room placement, special class placement,
              special day school placement, homebound program placement, and
              residential placement. Once a child is deemed eligible for special
              education, a formal Individualized Education Program (IEP) team
              determines the kind of special education service for the student.

              Self-reflection or introspection refers to the process of
              scrutinizing and analyzing oneself so as to grow and develop as a
              person. It is important as it helps one to readjust to where they
              feel they ought to be. Self-reflection in education is also
              necessary for both teachers and students. It gives teachers the
              awareness of what is and what is not effective in their classes so
              as to revise their activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              As aforementioned, self-reflection is a process. In teaching, the
              first step in the process is to be clear about what one wants to
              reflect upon. To find out, a teacher can begin collecting data
              through means such as observation of students, video recordings,
              questioning oneself or consulting their self-reflection journal
              (Cox, 2014). Some teachers prefer using peer observation but it
              may not always give accurate feedback due to misinformation. With
              the gathered data, instructors can analyze them and implement new
              measures or improve the current ones so as to make their teaching
              more effective. Self-reflection should not always target
              correcting mistakes but should also seek to improve on existing
              strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Self-reflection is also very essential to students as it not only
              improves their learning outcomes, but also promotes self-regulated
              learning (Mizrahi, n.d.). Students do not like hearing that they
              have made mistakes but teachers must help them anyway. Encouraging
              self-reflection not only makes students to accept where they are
              at fault, it also helps them get back on track. There are many
              ways to encourage self-reflection among students. The first and
              most important step to take is to explain what self-reflection is
              and discuss its benefits. Secondly, teachers should give
              reflections during class time. Teachers should try and spare some
              lesson time to let students reflect on some assignments (Mizrahi,
              n.d.). It is more effective compared to letting them schedule
              their time or letting them reflect at home because they would
              likely not do anything. Finally, encourage different reflection
              techniques: in pairs or groups, video, or written reflections.
              Accepting all the above means will allow students use their most
              favored means.

              {" "}
              Self-reflection and goal setting often work hand in hand and most
              teachers use them together to make students review their work and
              make decisions for the future. Whereas reflection refers to the
              making of resolutions after careful analysis and thought, a goal
              is a target mark that requires investment and effort to reach.
              Goal setting usually leads to self-reflection to strategize on how
              to achieve.

              Self-reflection is one of the basic tools in solving problems.
              Solving problems through self-reflection is often referred to as
              reflective problem solving. Earlier on, this discussion mentioned
              collecting data as the first step in self-reflection in teaching.
              Collecting data is a way of identifying a problem. Basically,
              self-reflection is always a means of identifying problems and
              seeking resolutions. Hence, the process of thinking about the
              cause of a problem and breaking it down to small bits to try and
              find solutions is self-reflection. For effectiveness, it should
              not be a passive activity and it should entail asking questions,
              thinking, and finding answers to the questions.

              Teacher-centered instruction requires students to focus
              exclusively on the instructor. Furthermore, students work alone in
              all class activities given by the instructor as collaboration is
              not allowed. As a result, the classroom is normally quiet while
              using this strategy. Student-centered learning, on the other hand,
              places the workload on the learner and the focus gets shared
              between instructor and students. Learners discuss with the teacher
              openly and collaborate and communicate with each other. Hence, it
              mostly results in a noisy classroom environment. Teacher-centered
              approach is appropriate when introducing new concepts and when
              dealing with topics and subjects that have formulas and
              procedures. Student-centered method is appropriate for topics
              encountered before and those that accommodate diverse
              interpretations such as literary criticism. It is upon instructors
              to decide when it is appropriate to use either.

              Assessments and evaluations inform instructors on the level of
              students’ understanding. To incorporate student self-assessment
              into the student-centered instruction, it is appropriate to put
              the students in groups and set clear targets for each. Hence, the
              students can easily compare their progress against the set goals.
              On the other hand, instructors can also carry out self-reflection
              by giving students summative tests after each topic or after each
              lesson.

              Comparisons of educational outcomes in different countries has
              always been a common practice, especially since the mid-20th
              century. At its inception, comparative and international education
              seemed like a pipe dream. In the words of perhaps the greatest
              figure in present-day comparative and international education,
              George Bereday, the responsible institutions were comparing the
              incomparable (Bereday, 1964). It is easy to understand his stand
              considering the incredible number of variables involved. There are
              many cultures involved, many different education systems and
              different curricula in different countries (Leung and Park, 2014).
              Furthermore, the age factor presents its challenges considering
              different countries and education systems have varying schooling
              years. However, over the years, researchers and educationalists
              have tried to come up with methods to assess academic outcomes
              internationally. Bodies such as the International Association for
              the Evaluation of Educational Achievements (IEA), the Organisation
              for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Trends in
              International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) have played a
              significant role in international educational assessment. The
              OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is
              responsible for many countries’ interests in comparative
              education.

              The primary objective of governments, policy makers and
              educationalists all around the world is realising educational
              improvements (Oates, 2017). This explains the shock that comes
              with the rankings and the consequent seriousness countries put
              into making amends. Germany, for instance, only took international
              large-scale assessments seriously after the after the results of
              the first round of PISA assessments badly harshly exposed their
              underperformance compared to other countries (Waldow, 2009).
              Germany did not have a harmonised method of measurement in its
              education system for a long time (Lundahl and Waldow, 2009).
              Furthermore, the country disparaged international assessments on
              the grounds that the key aspects of education are not measurable
              (Bos and Postlethwaite, 2002). As a result of the alienation from
              international academic comparisons, the PISA results were not
              especially kind towards them. German learners scored poorly in
              many fields compared to other learners from the other
              participating countries (Waldo, 2009). Furthermore, the difference
              between the highest and lowest scorers was particularly large in
              the country. The results made Germany take steps to improve and
              consequently many educational researchers took an interest in the
              issue (see: Hentig: 2003; Ertl, 2006; Gruber, 2006; Seiverth,
              2007). An almost similar shock hit the United Kingdom after the
              2009 results that saw the nation drop from the last rankings. The
              United States also got surprised to realise that 15 year old
              learners in China were performing better than their peers in the
              US (Gove, 2010). All the above realisations validate the move for
              countries to compare their educational outcomes with others.

              As mentioned earlier, the main objective of international
              comparisons is to make improvements. Leung and Park (2014) explain
              it from a Minister of Education’s point of view: what questions
              would they seek to answer with regards to the educational
              situation within the country. Some of the questions according to
              Leung and Park would be in areas such as differences between
              sub-groups of learners such as age and gender, differences and
              similarities between schools in other systems and ours and the
              level of achievements of learners in other systems comparable to
              ours. The process of benchmarking from other systems or countries
              is not an easy one due to the number of factors involved such as
              complexities of the educations systems, cultural differences,
              curriculum designs and contexts of implementation. Hence, it is
              common for certain systems to work for some countries and not for
              others. This paper intends to discuss what can be learnt in
              educational comparisons and the associated advantages and
              disadvantages.

            <h2>Lessons to Learn</h2>
            <h3>The Role of Context</h3>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The issue of context has over the years proven to be key in the
              determination of the effectiveness of a particular strategy.
              Policy makers need to always seek answers to the what and how
              certain actions can impact learning. For instance, what could
              result from reducing class sizes or hiring a specialized math
              teacher and what how could it affect sub-groupings such as gender?
              According to Oates (2017), understanding the specifics of
              something and its underlying basic assumptions is the key to
              successful implementation. However, it has the effects of
              narrowing the objectives, making them more initiative-grounded.
              However, there is no harm in going that direction as long as it
              realises positive results. Poor implementation has mostly been
              cited whenever a system that worked well elsewhere fails in a
              different place. Implementation is just a minor piece in the
              puzzle with the main problem being understanding the context and
              complexity of the system. Furthermore, even narrowing to specific
              elements of the system can still result in failure where there is
              no proper understanding of the interaction between the elements.
              These elements comprise assessments and teaching strategies among
              others. Understanding the complex relationship between the
              elements is important and there is sufficient evidence to prove
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Firstly, there is enough evidence from the history of many
              countries of the failure of specific schemes arrived at after long
              periods of research (Oates, 2017). Researchers would study a
              system on a small-scale and come up with recommendations on how to
              implement it on large-scale to realise improvements but it does
              not always work to plan. England is an example of a nation that
              has suffered such as feat. After a thorough international research
              review, analysts came up with an initiative to improve academic
              performance that placed a lot of emphasis on formative assessment.
              However, trials with the practices in a few places failed to
              produce the anticipated results, falling way below their
              expectations (Oates, 2017). Investigations attributed the fall to
              the influence of certain outside accountability issues often
              interfering with the teaching process (Ravitch, 2016).
              Accountability is of prominence when it comes to implementing
              complex systems (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
              Development, 2013); in the England case, therefore, lack of proper
              alignment between accountability and the formative assessment
              resulted in the poor results (Oates, 2017). It, therefore, pointed
              out the need no understand the key elements of educational
              arrangements and how they would interact in different contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Secondly, a comprehensive research by Schmidt and Prawat in 2006
              shed light on the essentiality of alignment of the key elements of
              arrangements: pedagogy, assessment, teaching strategies and so on.
              Their study relied on data from the Trends in International
              Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) studies – a worldwide study
              of international education that began in 1995. They studied the
              high performing nations and realized that in their settings, the
              curriculum focusses on fewer items communicates the objectives and
              expectations very clearly (Schmidt and Prawat, 2006). This
              decision making concerning what to teach, how to teach and taking
              necessary steps to communicate the procedures clearly is what the
              study termed curriculum coherence. According to Oates (2017), a
              coherent system is one whose national curriculum content, course
              books, teaching material, pedagogy and assessments are associated
              and support each other. A second observation their study cited was
              curriculum control exercised through leadership and political
              organisation. Hence, their study proved the importance of managing
              both the forms of education arrangement components and the
              relations between them.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              To sum up the issue of context, looking at high performing
              jurisdictions, there is a much emphasis on the vitality of the
              nature of relations between educational arrangements. A few
              examples include Hong Kong, Shanghai and Massachusetts. They have
              very different forms of educational arrangements but one thing in
              common between them is improvement of their performance over the
              years. A closer look into their systems reveals that they all have
              cautious management strategies of the elements in their systems.
              Hence, to achieve success using any arrangement, equal importance
              should be put on the relations between elements as to the specific
              elements themselves – forms of assessment, pedagogy, textbooks and
              curricula.
            </p>
            <h3> Culture</h3>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The role culture plays in the success of a national education
              system has never gone unnoticed. Starting with the attitude and
              perception of society towards education to parental dedication and
              historical events within a setting, the behaviour of all
              participants is in the way of its influence (Oates, 2017). For
              instance, part of the reason Finland has managed to rank high in
              the international assessments is because of the elderly members of
              the population’s respect for teachers. This respect and positivity
              towards teachers influences the learners’ attitudes, significantly
              affecting their behaviour, motivation, innovation and decision
              making (Oates, 2017). To maintain the academic dominance, the
              Finnish education system gets incessantly revised in response to
              recognised changes in the youth culture (Oates, 2017). This
              started at the beginning of the 21st century when the standards of
              the education system were declining gradually due to alleged
              shifts in the culture of the youth. As a result, it became
              necessary to reconstruct the curriculum to try and stop the
              decline. The above illustration indicates that culture, when made
              an entity of educational plans, can help achieve positive results.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Claims have been made before over the tendency of culture to stand
              in the way of importation of specific educational practices from
              other jurisdictions. However, these claims, as Oates (2017)
              describes, result from naïve ‘policy borrowing’ efforts. What most
              researchers in the past have failed to consider is the capability
              of culture to mutate to match a specific system and possibly
              promote it as in the case of Finland mentioned above. Hence,
              whereas every country has a culture, educational policies have
              both an opportunity to change the ‘learning culture’ and also
              accommodate changes in the youth culture (Oates, 2017). This is
              because a school, besides being an institution, it also a
              community only with greater self-containment.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Evidence of culture being used as an object of educational
              policies can be seen from England and Finland as earlier
              mentioned. When England revised its National Curriculum between
              2010 and 2013, it reviewed the Confucian-derived models of ability
              and progression that were part of the system (Oates, 2011). The
              models in commonality emphasize that every child has the capacity
              to learn anything presented to them as long as it is well
              exhibited and they put an effort into learning it. The revision
              challenged some ideas of the models such as differentiated
              instruction and individualised learning that were no longer
              effective in light of the changing youth culture (Oates, 2017).
              Furthermore, the national assessments based on levels of education
              within the systems got loosed and were no longer mandatory. The
              revision saw alignment of the swotted Confucian models with some
              specific recommended models of ‘pace’ and ‘mastery’ meant to not
              only increase achievements, but also create a level of
              equilibrium.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              In summation, there is no denial that culture can have negative
              effects on the education system, even within a country’s
              boundaries. Different cultures may exist within a country that
              push for specific approaches to education and learning. The
              cultural difference theory affirms that learners raised in
              different cultural settings approach education differently (Lynch,
              2016). Hence, crossing international borders exposes education
              systems to cultures that may or may not favour the arrangements.
              However, understanding the culture of a setting before
              implementing an arrangement can abridge the process by finding a
              way to incorporate culture into the system. Making culture an
              object of education policy as seen from the Finnish and English
              systems above mentioned, prevents failures in implementation of
              new systems.

              <h3>Control Factors</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Control factors encompass all the things in direct engagement with
              the education policy. Within every education system, there are
              several factors that interact and their relations determine the
              effectiveness of the system. Hence, it is necessary to understand
              them and how they interact for successful implementation of a
              system. Oates (2017) lists the following control factors common in
              every arrangement:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <em>Curriculum content </em>. The term describes the entirety
                  of what is to be imparted in a system and comprises items such
                  as national standards, textbooks, aims statements and support
                  materials.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Pedagogy.</em> This is a term describing the teaching and
                  learning methods. Assessment and qualifications. Refer to the
                  means of measuring the achievements of the set goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Accountability.</em> Simply refers to answerability and
                  comprises accountability models, data collection methods,
                  publication of data, and goals and criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Governance.</em> Refers to control arrangements of a
                  system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Professional development.</em> Refers to how instructors
                  continue to enhance their skills to manage better handle
                  learner needs. Comprises such things as training,
                  unionisation, professional roles and responsibilities and
                  performance measurement. Other control factors according to
                  Oates (2017) include funding, inspection, institutional
                  developments, allied social measures and national framework
                  among others.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <h2> Explanatory Factors</h2>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Whereas control factors are in direct confrontation with education
              policy, explanatory factors are often hidden from purposeful
              strategy and hence, education policy does not encounter them
              directly (Oates, 2017). An example is historical legacy pertaining
              to society’s dedication to education. While it can affect
              education systems significantly, for instance, attitudes of
              parents and learners towards education, it is not something open
              to or controllable by policy. Oates (2017) mentions the following
              explanatory factors:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <em>Global economy.</em> Comprises issues such as labour
                  movements that may affect systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Domestic economy.</em> The economic status within the
                  country.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Culture. </em>The identity marker for instance, social
                  structure and family culture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Political structures and commitments</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Historical contingencies.</em> Chance-influenced
                  happenings such as conflicts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Natural environment</em>. Things such as calamities,
                  disasters and climate change that policy cannot control.
                </li>
              </ol>
              An instance of how explanatory factors affect systems is seen in
              the case of Finnish teachers. The country has a history of
              respecting and valuing teachers. Hence, it is easier to realise
              educational improvements in the country. However, it is not a
              privilege available to every country and system.

              Strengths and Limitations of International Educational Comparisons
            </h2>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Countries have varying differences in their curriculum designs for
              each level of learning. The differences in the curricula and the
              learning systems can make it hard to compare countries but it
              researchers have found ways to manoeuvre and hence, countries can
              benefit from comparative studies. There are several benefits that
              studies on international educational achievements have on
              countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, it places countries under obligation to scrutinise their
              curriculum (Beaton, 1999). Curricula require continual revisions
              because they become outdated with time and fail to cover some
              emerging issues and culture shifts. Germany is a perfect example
              of a country that utilised international studies to improve the
              education system. After the PISA shock of 2001, Germany used the
              results as an object to formulating educational policy (Waldo,
              2009). The German Government acted on the results, using them as a
              source of data to compare their system to other high performing
              systems rather than as a source of policy solutions (Oates, 2017).
              The UK also successfully reviewed her national curriculum
              following the PISA 2009 results. The revision of the curriculum
              saw the country grant schools more freedoms, allowing them to drop
              unnecessary bureaucratic burdens (Gove, 2010). Sometimes
              curriculum changes may call for dropping of some subject areas at
              the expense of others depending on the trending needs of learners
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Secondly, research on comparative education often leads to a
              better understanding of one’s domestic education system (Afdal,
              2019). In the process of comparing one’s education system against
              those of other countries, researchers go through a lot of sources
              and in the process get to understand their education system more
              (Broadfoot, 2000). It thus places them in a better position to
              question some aspects of the arrangement and make recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Thirdly, international education studies deepen the understanding
              of how education interacts with society and context (Afdal, 2019).
              Through studying different cultural contexts, researchers
              understand the cultural contexts influencing the teaching and
              learning process. Alexander (1999) calls the findings – policy
              planning, teaching and learning, educational content creation,
              developing policy and practice strategies, etc. – ‘a window of the
              culture.’ Identifying these factors is the first step towards
              successful implementation of education policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Finally, the studies can promote and improve understandings of
              international practices. According to Arnove (2013), comparative
              studies provide researchers with a lot of data on the effects
              globalisation has on different contexts of education. Education
              does not escape the rapid globalisation and efforts for uniformity
              characteristic of the current world. The studies, therefore,
              provide data on the learning needs of multicultural settings
              (Afdal, 2019).
            </p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The limitations and strengths are tangled and often the latter
              ends up becoming a cause for the former.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Firstly, the tests used in international assessments including
              PISA and TIMSS focus on very narrow areas that are possible to
              measure. To most people, education has become an economic activity
              whose main aim is to groom people for work. As a result, some
              countries have customized their curricula and tests to only coach
              learners on how to pass tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Another worrying issue is the reliability of the tests. Not all
              the countries are in the same economic situation and hence, it
              loses meaning when, for instance, the United States gets compared
              with a developing country. Besides the difference in cultures, the
              scale of education is also different. Furthermore, viewing of
              education as something to discuss across all countries and
              standardising the collected data only increases unquestioned
              assumptions (Afdal, 2019).
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              {" "}
              In conclusion, international comparison of academic achievements
              is a good thing for improvement purposes. However, the results, so
              far, do not cover all countries sufficiently. Furthermore, the
              education systems have a lot of challenges within country borders
              due to the different cultures and resource endowment. My
              experience being a part of a program in Beijing aimed at promoting
              primary education opened my eyes to realities I had not perceived
              before. The program excelled in Beijing well due to the abundance
              of resources in the city and the presence of universities – the
              frontrunners in implementing the program. However, in the long
              run, it is creating a gap between the regions that can meet the
              requirement and those lagging behind in development. Hence, even
              though studies on educational improvements effectively consider
              culture and contexts of different countries, the generalisation is
              huge and results in imbalance within countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              . While borrowing is important, it is unnecessary when there is no
              proper understanding of the learning environment within a country.
              Issues of context exist between countries but are even more within
              a particular country. Therefore, while I favour comparative
              educational research, I would recommend more research also on how
              to bridge the education inequality gaps within countries.
