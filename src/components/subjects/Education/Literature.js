          <Accordion.Body>
            <p>
              The author of the novel Beloved is Toni Morrison. The novel which
              was published in the year 1987 won Pulitzer prize for fiction in
              the year 1988. The novel explores the ruinous tradition of
              servitude as it annals the life of a Black lady named Sethe, from
              her pre-Civil War days as a slave in Kentucky to her time in
              Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1873. Despite the fact that Sethe lives there
              as a liberated person, she is held detainee by recollections of
              the injury of her life as a slave. This essay explores the plot
              summary of the novel Beloved and some key themes.{" "}

            <p>
              After the death of baby Sugg, Denver and Sethe are distant from
              everyone else in the house, with the apparition of the child who
              passed on years back. Furniture, and even individuals, frequently
              move around strangely. Sethe has acknowledged the loss and misery
              caused by the demise of baby Sugg as she puts it “ Counting of the
              stillness of her own sehe had forgotten the other one: the soul of
              her baby girl” (Morrison), this is until Paul D Garner whom they
              were acquainted together during the slavery days arrives. Sethe
              invites Paul D into the house, and the two become a couple. Denver
              is disturbed about this course of action. Be that as it may, the
              phantom of the infant has appeared to vanish, and Denver and Sethe
              finds peace

              Beloved offers a frightening narrative of the effects of slavery
              and it is effects that afterward that torments an individual. The
              seriously moving and stunning story was written in variety of
              voices and extensive fragmentary discourses, which, similar to the
              personality of Beloved herself, are once in a while uncertain.
              Morrison's delightful language and extreme symbolism, in any case,
              were properly celebrated in this exemplary work. A film variation
              featuring Oprah Winfrey was featured in 1998.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Themes are the central and frequently all-inclusive thoughts
              investigated in an artistic work. Beloved investigates the
              emotional, spiritual, physical and otherworldly decimation created
              by slavery, an annihilation that proceeds to frequent those
              individuals who are currently in their freedom but previously
              slaves. Slavery negatively affects an individual’s
              self-appreciation and dignity. Beloved has various instances where
              self-estrangement is portrayed. Paul can hear a perpetual shouting
              and he cannot entirely figure out if it is just an illusion of his
              mind or it is real; this is an instance of estrangement and the
              novel contains various instances of self-estrangement. The slaves
              were impacted with the notion that there were not fully human
              whose value can be made in monetary terms. Thusly, Paul D
              constantly ponders if he is rallying a “man” at all and every now
              and again wonders about his incentive personally.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              The structure of the work is compounded with a consistently
              exchanging perspective. Every character which includes the
              half-alive ones and even the dead ones tell portions of the
              Beloved’s story. At a certain point, Seth and Paul share
              Flashbacks. At certain point the story of certain men who
              perceives slaves as restrained creatures is shared wholeheartedly
              by four white individuals. The assorted perspective of individuals
              who are intertwined by the present and the past make an
              embroidered artwork of individuals.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion the novel beloved was written by Toni Morison. The
              novel explores the effect slavery has on individuals. The acts
              that Denver and Sethe have done torments them giving them an
              illusion of things moving strangely in the house. Beloved explores
              the physical, emotional and physical effects that slavery brings.
              The novel narrates the events through assorted means such as
              flashbacks and dialogues.{" "}

          <Accordion.Header>A REVIEW OF JORDAN PEELE’S US</Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Us is a horror film that explores the notion that every human has
              a doppelgänger somewhere who is a mirror of all their activities.
              Following the literal happenings in the movie makes it a form of
              entertainment, though scary. However, a closer look allows a
              metaphoric interpretation of the images Peele uses to communicate
              some central ideas. The presence of doubles who are bitter and
              violent is a mirror of the duality in American society. The
              violence exhibited by the doppelgängers is an image of the
              discrimination-motivated crimes in the United States society. The
              discussion below considers some of the main ideas in the movie and
              what they speak about society in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              Us demonstrates the failure of institutions to bridge racial and
              class inequalities. Instead, institutions such as schools,
              prisons, and the government are widening the gaps in society. Red
              mentions that the doppelgängers are a result of a government
              experiment. The government created them to try and exercise
              control over their counterparts, but the test failed. As a result,
              they got locked up underground to endure the negative actions of
              their counterparts. For instance, as someone eats a good meal,
              their double would instead eat raw meat. The author makes
              references to the past when the protagonist first met her double
              and the aftermath. He mirrors the beginning of racial
              discrimination in the United States. Whites, since the colonial
              era, saw themselves are superior to blacks. Hence, all privileges,
              beauty, and status got associated with them (Feagin, no pg.).
              Blacks, on the other hand, were like the doubles in the movie.
              Their lives got controlled by whites’ decisions and activities.
              The violent reactions of the doppelgängers are reflective of the
              hate-motivated crimes in society.
            </p>
            <p>
              The classroom setup in the movie indicates the societal duality in
              the country. Whereas some people are rich and afford to lead
              lavish lifestyles, some are extremely poor and stuck there despite
              their efforts. The gap between the rich and the poor widens by the
              day due to the economy's changes that favor the rich. Hence, those
              born from poor backgrounds today will most likely end up poor for
              the rest of their life. Katz & Mark (no pg.) point to poverty
              being especially prevalent among African Americans. According to
              them, the discrimination that saw African Americans not getting
              good industrial jobs in the colonial era. Even though the poor are
              working hard to lift their living standards, the living standards
              are also rising. Hence, the poor are stuck in a prison they cannot
              get out of easily. Most prisoners in the country are from poor
              backgrounds – most of them blacks – and often end back there once
              released. This is because of the bitterness they have towards the
              rich which results in hate crimes. In the film, “the Tethered” are
              in an underground location where the government locked them up.
              They could not have escaped had Adelaide not met her double
              opening a pothole as a result. They all wear jumpsuits that are
              symbolic of prison uniforms. The Tethered, just like the poor
              blacks in society, have bitterness against their counterparts.
              Hence, once they manage to breach into the world, they kill their
              counterparts mercilessly. Peele symbolizes the bitterness the less
              privileged bear due to the inequality in society and their
              inability to impact change no matter their efforts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tethered stating that "we are Americans" points to the
              hypocrisy in the country which is ironic considering the name
              “United States.” The movie’s title is Us but it is a motif that
              signifies the United States. Hence, it is a mirror of the nation
              in the form of art. The Tethered, despite being shut away, claim
              they are part of the American society. Hence, Peele indicates that
              those in the prosperous end and those in the struggling end are
              two sides of a coin. In a way, he insinuates that the fortunate
              should not think highly of themselves and fail to help lift the
              poor. Doubles are symbolic of other people who may have occupied
              our position and status in society. However, due to the limited
              resources on their part, they may not have gotten the chance to
              attain the proper qualifications. Peele reminds the audience about
              the "Hands Across America” campaign of 1986 through the act of the
              doubles holding hands. The move meant to raise money to alleviate
              poverty. It managed to raise over $34 million, but the operation
              costs consumed more than half the amount. In the end, only about
              $15 million remained for donations. Even though the campaign
              received praise, it was a shiny surface on top of a dark one. Just
              like the way the movie portrays the doubles as darkness while
              their counterparts get celebrated. Peele is, therefore, mocking
              the insincerity in some of the efforts to bridge the inequalities
              in society.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              In conclusion, despite being an entertaining piece of art, the
              movie has a deep meaning and message to society. It handles issues
              in society that have a deep history. The author uses a symbolic
              language that allows the audience to deduce many lessons out of
              it. Furthermore, horror is a popular genre in the community.
              Hence, what better means to pass a message to the public? The use
              of doppelgängers is both a humorous and interesting idea. It
              attracts audiences and especially makes them think about the
              theory of parallel universes that has recently appeared in science
              and popular culture. Peele achieves his objectives with more ease
              compared to other filmmakers who have tried more direct
              approaches. He combines objectivity, with symbolism to illustrate
              the extent of inequality in society. More effectively, he uses a
              popular movie genre to ensure a bigger audience gets access to his
              ideas.

              They told her that the island was haunted, but on that sweltering
              summer day when she first arrived, she believed it was nonsense.
              Now, however, things were different. Everything had gone against
              her expectations, and now as she sat huddled on one corner of the
              tent, she was beginning to regret everything. Her two friends were
              out, one of whom had been missing for two days now. She blamed
              herself for having dragged her friends into the current situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Her curiosity to explore the island responsible for her parents’
              untimely death had finally gotten the better of her despite
              everyone warning her against it. Her grandmother, who was her sole
              guardian for as long as she could remember, had always refrained
              from talking about the island. On a Christmas gathering, she had
              once eavesdropped on some of her aunts' conversation and overheard
              them talking about her parents' demise. No one seemed sure, but
              presumably, they got caught by a wave while escaping from the
              island. No one from the family had been to the island since then,
              and that is what got her planning. She had, therefore, convinced
              two of her friends, Jim and Kay, to go camping with her to the
              island, hoping to unravel the mystery behind it. Her friends were
              super excited by the idea, and Jim promised to get them a ride to
              the island. They were later to know that he stole his father’s
              boat for the adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Their first day on the island was a memorable one. They found a
              small fishing village on the island, but they were surprised to
              find no more than five inhabitants in it, all of them men. They
              were very hospitable and took them around the place, showing them
              different kinds of fish. They later offered them some food to eat,
              which comprised roasted fish and some vegetables. She found
              herself wondering why such a lively group of people would choose
              to be isolated from the rest of the world. Later on, they went to
              pitch their tents on the opposite side of the island and made a
              fire, preparing to retire for the day. She was to share a tent
              with Kay while Jim used the other. They took out their packed food
              and ate their supper around the fire. After chatting for a while,
              they retired to their tents.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The second day began well. They went sightseeing to a nearby
              waterfall and admired the beauty of the scene. Jim saw some vines
              hanging from the trees and dared the girls to swing on them with
              him.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Hey, Pam," he called out to her, "watch me." He took hold of a
              vine and went flying over the waters and back. She did not seem
              amused, but Kay found it amazing. Amid pressure from the two of
              them, she tried the swing too, and she actually liked it. They
              played on for a while, and Jim excused himself to check on the
              boat. She returned to their campsite with Kay having a light
              conversation all the way. Kay was criticizing her dateless life
              and trying to point out that Jim has always had a crush on her
              since junior high school. She tried to ignore her, but she would
              not stop badgering her to explain the cause of her leading a
              reserved life. She did not get a chance to answer, for out of the
              blue, there was a lightning flash followed by deafening thunder.
              The weather was changing fast, and they had to run quickly to the
              safety of their tent. Heavy downpour followed, and their greatest
              fear was their tent getting carried away. Jim was another of their
              worries. The rain stopped, but Jim still did not come back. They
              went out in search of him and found neither the boat nor him.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The third day was the most boring of all. Pam woke up to find Kay
              already up; she claimed she had hardly slept. They ate something
              and went out to look for Jim, first to the fishing village.
              Another rude shock awaited them, for they found no one in the
              entire place. At the shore, the boat seemed to have resurfaced,
              but there was no sign of Jim. Pam began having a bad feeling about
              the island. Perhaps it was really haunted as she had often gotten
              warned. She looked at Pam, who looked like she was going to cry,
              and gave her a hug. They decided to split up and attempt to cover
              as much ground as possible in the search for their partner. They
              were to meet up at the campsite at noon.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Noon arrived, and Pam had found nothing after combing her
              designated area thoroughly. She waited for Kay at the campsite,
              but she did not arrive after an hour of waiting. She, therefore,
              decided to go into the tent and find something to eat. The wonder
              of all wonders, the interior of the tent was empty. Now she was
              certain this island was haunted. Jim's tent was empty too. She
              decided to wait outside, hoping that Kay would appear soon.
              Twilight was quickly approaching, and Kay was not back. Feeling
              cold, she went into the tent and hurdled herself up in a corner,
              waiting for whatever eventuality, bringing us to the current
              picture. She stayed in the position for a while, pondering about
              taking the boat all alone and leaving the god-forsaken island. Her
              train of thought got interrupted by a series of fast-approaching
              footsteps, making her realize it was already dark outside. Her
              instincts told her to run, and she did exactly that once outside
              the tent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The footsteps became faster, and she increased her pace, but they
              got louder and louder. Her energy was quickly fading when she
              heard a shout behind her.
              <br />
              “Won’t you stop?”

              {" "}
              Kay? She stopped Kay immediately collapsed onto arms sending them
              both into a heap on the ground. She was out of breath and tried
              frantically to explain what happened to her in a panicky voice.
              Pam did not wait to hear much. She quickly pulled her to her feet
              and dragged her away towards the boat. The rain started again, and
              lightning struck a tree branch right behind them. They managed to
              get to the boat, and Pam fumbled with its controls, finally
              managing to get it moving. It was then that she realized that Kay
              was bleeding on her forehead and had passed out. The waters grew
              wild too and rocked their boat forth and back. She lost her
              balance while trying to attend to her and knocked her elbow
              against the side of the boat. Pain seared through the entire arm,
              and she realized she could not move it. Another wave rocked the
              boat again, this time throwing her farther away from Kay. The pain
              intensified, and she lay still in despair. She thought she saw a
              light in the distance before she shut her eyes.

              Pam felt a strong pair of arms lift her and carry her gently. When
              she came to, she was on her bed at home. Her grandmother was
              staring down at her with a worried expression. Beside her was her
              favorite uncle John and his wife, Aurora. She was later to learn
              that it was her uncle who had saved the day. Her grandmother did
              not look pleased at all as she informed her that Kay was in the
              hospital. She had lost a lot of blood and almost lost her life.
              Unfortunately, Jim's whereabouts were unknown, but there was an
              ongoing search for him. Her grandmother then proceeded to tell her
              that her parents drowned after their boat capsized while they were
              leaving the island. She sobbed uncontrollably for what she had
              caused even though it made her grandmother open up to her. She
              embraced her grandmother and crying all the while. She understood
              that her grandmother had been protecting her feelings by keeping
              her in the dark. However, her curiosity almost caused her a
              similar fate to her parents.
            </p>
            <p>
              This story has, and the previous have a lot of similarities. In
              the previous story, a girl harbors hard feelings for her father
              and his lover and blames them for dishonoring her mother's memory.
              It does not occur to her that they may be genuinely in love with
              each other, and she only realizes that when her father dies in her
              arms. She then feels apologetic and accommodative towards the
              other lady. Similarly, in the story above, Pam insists on
              confronting the cause of her parents' deaths, not bothering to
              think of the consequences. In the end, one of her friends gets
              injured while another disappears. Only then does she embraces the
              fact that her grandmother meant well by keeping details about her
              parents' deaths secret.

              Therefore, both stories show the importance of keeping our
              feelings in check and not letting them control our actions.
              Refusal to take into consideration both sides of a story can cause
              more hurtful experiences that would otherwise be avoidable.

            Stereotyping in The Breakfast Club Film
          </Accordion.Header>

            <p>
              {" "}
              A stereotype is a belief or perception associated with a specific
              group of people in general. Hence, any newcomer belonging to a
              known group of people gets the same treatment people from the
              class get. For instance, many people associate Arabic-Muslims with
              violence, and hence, any Arabic-Muslim sighted near a crime scene
              would easily become a suspect. Therefore, stereotyping is the
              grouping of people into social categories or classes based on
              their character traits. It is the chief cause of prejudiced
              notions and discrimination. In the United States, for instance,
              African Americans have often gotten associated with laziness and
              music. Hence, when hiring workers in a firm, one would likely pass
              on any African American on the presumption that they are lazy. As
              a result, the generalization victimizes every individual falling
              in the category even without putting them to the test. In the
              movie The Breakfast Club, stereotyping is one of the key themes.
              This discussion will seek to bring to light how society, including
              the characters themselves, perceive each other and how they manage
              to overcome it.

              The film features five teens schooling in the fictional Shermer
              High School reporting on a Saturday morning for detention for
              various reasons. The students are Clare Standish, Brian Johnson,
              Andrew Clark, John Bender, and Allison Reynolds. Claire’s reason
              for detention is that she missed classes to go shopping. Brian
              brought a gun to school and wanted to shoot himself with it for
              failing in a test. Andrew tapped some kid's butts together at his
              father's command. Bender got into a fight with the teachers and
              students in school after pulling a fire alarm. On the other hand,
              Allison was a voluntary inclusion since she was bored with her
              life, and her family gave her no attention. Stereotyping in the
              movie results from society's perception of the characters and
              their acceptance of the identities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clare comes from an affluent family, and all the kids in school
              associate her with pride and contempt, something typical of rich
              and spoilt teens. Even though it discriminates her from her peers
              since they consider her unreachable, she gladly lives to the
              reputation. She has the title of ‘princess’ in the movie to mark
              her high-class status. The movie gives her a somewhat exaggerated
              lifestyle that makes her extremely difficult to relate with. At
              the beginning of the detention, she dares to inform the
              headteacher that she is in the wrong company.

              Brian is naturally bright, and that comes from extreme studies,
              which explains his designation as the 'brain.' His parents believe
              that he should always pull good grades and incessantly mount
              pressure on him to study. On the ride to school for detention, all
              his family members jam themselves to the front seat and leave the
              entire backseat to him and his books. His father even reminds him
              to study harder during detention and condemn him for attempting to
              waste his scholarship. The 'bookworm' status has gotten into his
              head to the point of defining him. Hence, it is no surprise that
              he attempted suicide because of a failed test.

              Andrew's father is a wrestler and pressurizes him to follow in his
              footsteps. As a result, Andrew gets perceived as a wrestler too.
              His father continually bullies him and fights him, trying to bring
              the best out of him. For him, it is more a case of a parent's
              perception than personal choice. However, he is competent in
              wrestling and even uses some of his techniques to fight off Bender
              when he bothers him. The wrestler spirit is what eventually gets
              him into trouble.

            <p>
              {" "}
              Bender goes by the designation of 'the criminal' or 'the rebel.'
              He openly lives to the societal expectation that comes with the
              position. His dressing and walking style, even as he arrives in
              school for detention, tell it all. He nearly gets run over by a
              car, but he seems least concerned about it. Like the rest of his
              colleagues, the stereotype results from parental expectations and
              treatment. His father bullies him constantly, sometimes even
              burning him with a cigarette. As expected, he represents the
              criminals' clique well in school, in the process landing in
              detention. Even in detention, he does not drop his 'bad-boy'
              attitude. He starts harassing his peers and even suggests that
              they rape the prom queen – Claire. He earns himself more
              punishments, including getting locked up in a locker by the head.
              The criminal in him would remain unstoppable as he breaks out of
              the locker and continues getting himself into more trouble. Bender
              accepts the stereotype and does not let down his position in
              society.

              {" "}
              Finally, there is Allison, who is a surprising inclusion
              considering that she did not do anything wrong to deserve
              detention. Allison attends school for lack of a better place to be
              and, even in doing so, remains an outcast from her peers. Society,
              including her schoolmates, consider her an outcast, or as the film
              puts it, 'the empty basket case.' Her parents ignore her all the
              time, too, and it is evident as they drop her off for detention.
              They do not even bother to tell her bye, treating her like some
              baggage getting disposed. She does not mind the status, and she
              reciprocates by living a dull life reflected by her love of dark
              clothes and ever lowered head. Furthermore, she does not have any
              confidence in herself and does not even bother following up on
              fashions, tastes, or preferences. She acts like the outcast that
              she is.

            <p>
              {" "}
              The students begin the detention with the above perceptions of
              each other. They also perfectly play their roles as society
              demands. That explains why 'the princess' looks down on the rest
              of the group at the onset of their stay together. 'The rebel' also
              starts by sleeping instead of attempting the assignment given to
              them. 'The outcast' as usual, keeps her mouth shut and does what
              she does best – painting tattoos on herself using a pen. 'The
              wrestler' contains 'the rebel' while 'the brain' does his
              homework. However, deep down, they have their personalities that
              are not society-imparted. As time goes, they begin conversing, and
              that becomes the first step towards accepting each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Claire does not like the posh life she is in, but she struggles to
              fit in since she finds a sense of security being part of the
              crowd. She hates how her parents fight over because of her, and
              perhaps that drops a hint as to why she secretly grows fond of
              Bender; she wants someone tough. Even though she expresses dislike
              towards the group at first, and especially Bender, she later
              realizes that appearances can be blinding. She ends up falling for
              Bender. Brian also expresses his frustration with living to please
              his parents – being a satisficer. He has his goals but has to live
              according to his parents' provisions. Andrew deeply regrets
              tapping Larry's butts and every other activity his father has made
              him do. He is clearly not the person his father wants him to be.
              Bender also has a problem with his parents, particularly his
              father, for being hard on him and torturing him. He wishes to have
              a different life, not defined by society's or parents'
              expectations. Even the ever quiet Allison has her insecurities.
              Beneath the darkness is a soft heart that also wishes for human
              comfort and friendship. She also hates how her family does not
              mind her explaining why she would rather be in school. Even though
              she has low self-esteem, she still fears getting hurt if she opens
              up to the world.

              {" "}
              In conclusion, it is important to know that letting stereotyping
              define one's life blinds them to their true self. Opening up is
              the first step towards self-realization. The group, after having a
              conversation and smoking marijuana, help each other out of their
              dilemmas. Claire even makes up Allison, and Andrew immediately
              likes her. In the end, they all agree that the perception that
              society has of them should no longer define them. They realize
              that they have so much in common: things initially invisible due
              to the stereotypes surrounding each of them. Brian offers to do
              everyone’s assignment at Claire’s request. He writes a letter to
              the head, Mr. Vernon, informing him that his opinion of them is
              not who they really are. Andrew and Allison end up together, and
              so do Bender and Claire. Brian is the only one that remains
              single, but his newfound freedom is far more important.

            <h1>Identification Questions</h1>
            <h2>Self-Disclosure</h2>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Self-disclosure is a process of communication entailing sharing
              personal information with another person or a group. It is not
              always a voluntary process as there are times when people let
              information slip by accident. Self-disclosure may also result from
              an obligation, such as when one confides in a medical professional
              to find a solution to a problem. Either way, self-disclosure has
              both positive and negative sides, depending on the timing and
              audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Self-disclosure can either be verbal or non-verbal. Verbal entails
              sharing through word of mouth. Non-verbal involves communicating
              through clues such as body language, dressing, make-up, and
              tattoos. An example is from the movie mentioned earlier, where
              Allison communicates her little hope in life through her dark
              dressing. An instance of verbal disclosure from the same character
              is her admission to being a compulsive liar.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Self-disclosure serves several purposes in communication. Firstly,
              it is a way of winning over someone's trust, which is one way of
              establishing intimacy with people. It can also help someone in a
              leadership position have the support and trust of their subjects.
              Secondly, self-disclosure can make it easy to deal with new
              people. It makes them see the human side of someone and,
              therefore, easily establish trust and understanding. A perfect
              example is when dealing with visitors from a different
              organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              In conclusion, even though self-disclosure is an important tool
              for building relations, it is important to exercise caution when
              applying it. Firstly, it is good to know one's audience and its
              credibility to avoid future embarrassments. Secondly, one should
              only disclose information that they are sure will yield the
              desired result. If disclosure goes wrong, it can cause some severe
              damage to one’s name.
            </p>
            <h2> Roles and Norms </h2>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Roles and norms are important elements of an organization. Roles
              refer to the expected behavior patterns in an organization
              governed by one's status or position. On the other hand, norms
              refer to the unwritten patterns of behavior shared and accepted by
              everyone within an organization. Norms come up due to cultural
              beliefs, religious affiliations, attitudes, and an organization's
              culture. For instance, in most organizations, it is a norm for the
              managerial staff to have their meals away from the subordinate
              staff. Therefore, any mingling between the two sides would be a
              deviation from the norm and often creates discomfort. Whereas
              culture determines norms, position, or status determines roles.
              For instance, in a football team, a goalkeeper's role is different
              from that of a striker. The same applies to a midfielder and a
              defender.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Roles and norms often work together to dictate the social
              composition of society. Whereas roles inform people on what to do
              in their respective positions, norms give guidance on how to do
              them in a socially acceptable way. In a way, they teach people
              self-regulation by ensuring that they conform to social
              provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              In conclusion, norms and roles are an integral part of everyone's
              life, without which society would lack leadership. However, to
              some extent, they limit one to conform to the community's demands
              and prevent engaging in some personal leisure activities.
            </p>
            <h2>Systems Theory</h2>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Systems theory entails studying society and its constituent
              elements, including people, traditions, cultures, and
              interactions. An example is the study of a country with citizens
              of mixed origins. Herbert Spencer takes the credit for coming up
              with the approach of studying society in the early 19th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two approaches to social systems developed by different
              scholars. Herbert Spencer came up with a unitary form that viewed
              society developing and changing as a whole unit. According to him,
              the development was an improvement from a primitive form to a
              complex and evolved form as a whole. However, other scholars
              challenged his ideas and came up with an approach called
              structural differentiation. Their approach claimed that society
              was not moving towards a particular direction but rather was
              developing from the inside to a state of complexity. Hence,
              instead of evolving, it was instead adapting to changes through
              internal adjustments.
            </p>
            <p>

              In summary, systems theory is a study of society and how it
              responds to transitions and modifications. For instance, education
              and immigrations cause alterations to society by introducing new
              ideas and exposure to new cultures. Society has a way to
              accommodate such changes that though not planned for, happen
              anyway.

            <h2>Knapp’s Theory of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Knapp’s theory of interpersonal communication explains how people
              interact and form relationships. He explains it through five
              stages that are initiation, experimentation, intensifying,
              integration, and bonding.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Initiation is the first stage and often does not paint one's true
              picture since they are concerned about making a name for
              themselves. For instance, one would be extremely mindful of the
              choice of attire for the rendezvous. During this stage, most
              people would talk about their occupations, families, interests,
              and aspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The experimentation stage is second and where most people
              surprisingly part ways. In this stage, people get interested to
              know more about the other party, trying to establish things they
              have in common. For instance, in a boy-girl situation, this is the
              stage people get interested in knowing ‘favorites’: food, colors,
              and sports. In case there is not much to bond on, then the
              association comes to an end.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              The intensifying stage is where people lose formality and begin
              sharing deeper secrets about their lives. This is the point where
              boys often ask girls out for dates. Some of the common topics of
              discussion are past love life, past mistakes, and their future
              plans.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Integration is the fourth stage, and it involves getting closer
              and trying to create a lasting relationship. For boy-girl
              relationships, this is the point where they usually fall in love.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Finally, the bonding stage is where people make a commitment to
              each other to spend the rest of their lives together. It is a
              stage that involves the legalization of commitment.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              In conclusion, Knapp summarized human interactions in a fairly
              predictable manner. Any disagreement along the way would bring an
              end to the engagement. However, most successful relationships go
              through those stages.

              The title of the article by Robert and Gareth is a question, that
              is “Why should anyone be led by you”. The article further
              illustrates that when the question is posed to a room with
              Executives it usually makes them uneasy. The room they are in, is
              filled with silence as mostly each one of them do not have a
              rationale answer to that question. The article asserts that
              majority of the leaders in organizations are not the key players
              in the organization structure but they are rather boring beucrats.
              The article describes a true leader to be one who is confident in
              who they are and has the capability to inspire the staff to
              achieve exemplary results. This essay explores the ideas in the
              article alongside a summary of the ideological perspective of the
              authors and their strength and weaknesses.

              Robert and Gareth (2000) portray that an effective leader is not
              necessarily one who has entirely grasped the universal qualities
              of a leader, rather there are other factors that a leader should
              possess. The universal qualities of a leader are ambiguous as
              character varies from individuals. An effective leader should
              rather embrace themselves and utilize their strengths in to engage
              staff’s mind, heart and souls. This assures the consistency in
              their daily routines as one will be entirely comfortable in what
              they can do best.

              The research by Jones and Gareth (2000) describes how to improve
              the leadership skills while managing the inner tension. The first
              inner tension referred in the article is portraying emotion or
              holding it back in a leadership situation. Secondly getting
              acquainted to the staff while ensuring boundaries are not breached
              and lastly maintaining a leadership dignity. The authors
              accentuate the social idea of administration and investigates how
              the leaders can remain authoritative and at the same time in the
              expectation of the people they lead. The correct application of
              these variable will make a leader to be in a position to clearly
              answer the question “why should people be led by you”.

              work of other researchers. They agree that a leader needs a
              strategic direction, authority, energy and vision. Moreover, Jones
              and Gareth (2000) emphasis that an inspirational leader ought to
              poses four others more qualities. The leader should openly show
              their shortcomings portraying they are human and approachable.
              They also should depend intensely on instinct to measure the
              fitting plan and course of their activities, and finally they
              should oversee others with extreme sympathy and portray their
              disparities, capitalizing by their special characteristics.

              The article emphasize that a leader should poses the above
              qualities on top of other personal qualities. The staff need to be
              driven not by a leader with extravagant occupation title or a
              chief who has amassed a tremendous lump of authoritative force or
              region, as the staff will decide to follow a genuine, live,
              certifiable leader who reveals a portion of their vulnerability,
              personality, values and humanity. Jones and Gareth (2000) state
              that everything narrows down to three key principles for leader as
              they make the idea of that space among themselves and their staff;
              knowing oneself, dealing with the equilibrium in various parts of
              their acquaintance with the employees, and actively being involved
              in situational sensing.

              However, the article has assorted drawbacks. The writers
              consistently bring up that the article is a consequence of their
              broad examination of more than five years, yet there is little
              discussion and exploration of the methodology and techniques
              utilised in the research. The number of interviews, the inquiries
              or the finding of the interviews is not provided. The research is
              all by account more a progression of impression and recollection
              from hierarchical consultancy occupations as opposed to an
              efficient logical examination.

              In conclusion the title of the article explored is “why should
              anyone be led by you” by Robert and Gareth. The article asserts
              that when executives are posed with the question, they become
              uneasy. The authors stress on improvement of leadership skills
              while managing inner tension. A leader needs a strategic
              direction, authority, energy and vision in the daily management
              routine. More over a leader needs to openly show their
              shortcomings which portrays they are human and approachable; they
              also need to depend intensely on instinct to measure the fitting
              plan and course of their activities and finally they need to
              oversee others with extreme sympathy and portray their disparities

              Hidden intellectualism focuses on the hidden intellectual
              potential that is found on the street smart people. Gerald Graff
              explains his ideas on this topic of hidden intellectualism in an
              essay. The essay brings into comparison the book smart and the
              street smart. It explores and evaluates the highly misinterpreted
              and undervalued intellectualism of the street smart. Graff
              explains that intellectualism can be expressed in different ways
              and not only in an academic setting. He further suggests that
              students in academic settings should be allowed to venture and
              explore different subjects and interests in the world. He explains
              this idea of street smart with his own experience in the hood and
              his interaction with sports.

              Graff explains that his study of sports magazines was purely out
              of passion and interest, through this he was unknowingly becoming
              intellectual. He was doing that out of pure interest and not
              necessarily out of the love to study. Graff noticed later on that
              he used the reasoning and arguing strategies that he had gained
              with his interaction with sports to bring across his points
              effectively. The discussions and arguments he had with his friends
              on sports shaped his intellectualism and his approach to
              situations as time went on. His intellectual abilities were shaped
              by what may have been considered as an activity that was not
              intellectual.

              Growing up, Graff found himself stuck in the middle of being book
              smart and street smart. He was faced with the challenge of
              expressing his intellectual ability with the fear of getting a
              beating or being called names. Out of the fear of expressing his
              book smart side, he got involved in discussions of things such as
              sports and small discussions like discussing who the toughest kid
              was. In his interaction with these topics that are known to be
              anti-intellectual, his intellectual level grew. These topics
              allowed him to grow in his level of approaching varying
              situations, enhanced his communication skills, and allow him to
              articulately evaluate and analyze different topics.

              Schools have for a long time overlooked the importance of such

              only be shown through academic work which is a bad mentality
              according to Graff. He suggests that students should be allowed to
              explore the field that interests them and they can venture into
              such topics. He explains that the idea of book smart only is not
              sufficient proof of intellectualism. He identifies that there is
              hidden intellectualism in street smart and that schools should
              adopt practices to enhance that.

              According to the essay, children would be more enlightened and

              situations in the world and learn important skills in life. The

              involved in including these topics that are considered nonacademic

              and articles of sports, fashion, music, cars, and other such
              topics in order to encourage students to learn. He claims that
              students learn a lot of skills by reading and learn different ways

              topics that interest them.

              {" "}
              Yann Martel’s Life of Pi focuses on Pi, a teenager that gets
              stranded for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean after a ship-wreck
              kills his entire family. The story is a story within a story as
              the author places himself in it, constantly interrupting it to
              embed his personal experiences into it. Storytelling, thus, is a
              prominent theme that introduces other themes in creative ways. The
              author first hears about the Pi’s experiences from an old man,
              Francis Adirubasamy. Adirubasamy describes the story to the
              fictional author as: “a story that would make you believe in God”
              (Martel, 2009). Being at the onset of the movie, the statement
              introduces religion as a prominent theme brought about by
              storytelling. As the movie progresses, Pi gets portrayed as
              religious, practicing Hinduism, Christianity and Islam (Lee,
              2012). Each religion came with its stories and parables and he
              would not give up any one for another. Furthermore, he believed
              that science and religion could mutually co-exist unlike the
              popular belief. To him, it was about “the better story” to believe
              in especially at a time of duress and distress. He, therefore,
              accepts science as a fact giver and religion as a better option
              for the mind. For instance, science proves the existence of a
              zebra through a scientific name while religion calls it a creation
              of God. The author agrees with Mr Adirubasamy’s words after
              tracking Pi and getting the story from the horse’s mouth
              (Stephens, 2010). Seemingly, the author passes a message to the
              audience believing in God.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Pi’s belief in God stems not only from his curiosity to hear
              religious stories but also from his background. His full name was
              Piscine Molitar Patel – after a renowned French swimmer – and
              since most of the neighboring kids spoke English, they called him
              ‘Pee’ instead. He named himself Pi from the mathematical symbol
              ‘pi’ to cover the embarrassment. The bullying did not stop there
              as he got ridiculed because of his funny masculinity and even got
              kicked out of the boys club (Georgis, 2006). His only option was
              to turn to God and hence, his interest in religion grew. However,
              having had a scientific background of growing up in a zoo coupled
              with his love for his biology teacher Mr Kumar, he would not give
              up on science at the expense of religion. Instead, he accepted
              both, believing that religion provided a more convincing and
              imaginative account of everything, hence complementing the
              ‘dryness’ science had with facts (Stephens, 2010). His ideas of a
              “better story” resulted from his interaction with different
              accounts both in science and in religion and his faith. He
              preferred the religious allegories for their moral lessons and
              their imagination.

              In the author’s viewpoint Pi’s ‘better story’ was an epitome of
              faith and belief. The author also believed that the ‘better story’
              is the best overlay (Martel, 2009). In other words, one should
              seek what entertains and appeals to them best to believe in. To
              Pi, religion gave this ‘better story.’ The movie gives sufficient
              evidence qualifying religion as having the better story; enough to
              convince the audience to believe. Firstly, it portrays ‘better
              story’ as one that incorporates animals rather than diminish them.
              Religious stories have the tendency to balance animals and human
              beings contrary to contemporary culture where humans are masters
              and closer to machines than other mammals (Stephens, 2010). Pi
              grows up in a zoo and despite his parents’ warning against
              closeness to animals, he instead comes to consider human beings as
              greater dangers. Secondly, religious stories have redemptive
              promises unlike science accounts. The stories give significance to
              harsh experiences and give hope and encouragement during difficult
              times. Pi insists in the movie that a better story is always
              useful for the “reasonable self” especially during the hardest of
              times.

              {" "}
              In conclusion, the movie, through the narrator, attempts to
              convince the audience to embrace faith regardless of the religion.
              Pi in the movie practices pluralism and even though it leads to
              his expulsion from religious centers, it does not waver his faith
              in God. His faith, however, results from the quest to find the
              ‘better story’ to feed his imagination. Every religious
              denomination has its stories but the one thing they have in common
              is that they are all optimistic. The movie uses symbolism and
              allusion to enhance the theme of religion in a bid to prove its
              objectivity to the audience. For instance, Stephens (2010)
              explains Pi’s expulsion from church as a foreshadowing of Isaiah’s
              prophecy of the building of a “prayer house for all people”
              regardless of denomination (Isaiah 56:7). Furthermore, he cites
              Pi’s alienation from other human beings and the suffering he
              endures as a requirement of love (Isaiah 53:3). Hence, even though
              the movie maintains that Pi’s love for religion was because it
              offered a better story, the author tries to communicate something
              bigger to the audience.{" "}

              “Jahangir and his Father, Akbar,” is a painting from the 17th
              century found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City –
              the largest museum in the United States. In the painting, Jahangir
              – the fourth emperor of the Mughal Empire in India – is on the
              left with his father on his right. Jahangir appears to be
              gesturing entreatingly while Akbar, his father, holding a bird,
              leans towards him. Welch (no pg.) suggests in his book that the
              pose had a purpose given the nature of the relationship between
              father and son. Most of the Mughal lineage princes were
              characteristically at loggerheads with their fathers, and Jahangir
              was no exception. Had his brothers not all predeceased their
              father, he would never have become emperor. Hence, the gesture in
              the painting seems to suggest a reconciliation for the during and
              after succession. The heavenly light around Akbar seemingly
              represents the authority he still had (Welch, no pg.). This
              discussion will revolve around the painting to shed more light on
              its background.

              The accurate date of the painting's production is unknown, but the
              available evidence points to around 1630. This period was around
              the end of his reign and his death thereafter. The painting's
              setting is in India, precisely in the Mughal Empire that was in
              the Indian subcontinent and stretching into parts of present-day
              Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The colors in the painting were
              purposeful to represent the Indian geography.

              The painting of Jahangir and his father was the work of Balchand
              and Mir ‘Ali Haravi, the former being the artist and the latter
              being the calligrapher. Balchand was a Hindu artist but his later
              works seemed to opine that he had converted to Islam (Beach, p.
              95). His specialty was on imperial subjects and as a result, he
              gained easy access to royal compounds (metmuseum.org). However,
              even with the freedom to enter into royal enclosures, he chose not
              to put much focus on the imperial scenes, instead drawing from a
              distance. However, he had an eye for observation and detail and
              hence, his paintings all had a trademark specificity. The painting
              of and Jahangir and Akbar specifically represented their color
              preferences, especially in their dressing. The Mughals’ love for
              art was a prominent motivation for his work and the rise of other
              artists during Jahangir's reign.

              The painting’s intended target was the Mughal family. Even though
              Balchand specialized in imperial subjects in his work, he had a
              special closeness with the Mughal family. Most of the paintings
              done during Jahangir’s reign portrayed specific messages to the
              viewers. Most of them aimed at exhibiting his achievements and
              creating positive impressions, especially about his once sour
              relationship with his father. Balchand made this painting to help
              show that Jahangir had reconciled with his father at the time of
              his reign after his father's death. Before his ascension to the
              throne, it was no secret that there was a poor relationship
              between Jahangir and Akbar. Jahangir had gone to the extent of
              establishing his palace parallel to his father's and proclaiming
              himself emperor. Hence, given Jahangir's love for art and his
              tendency to communicate through paintings, Balchand purposefully
              intended to pass a message across. Firstly, because of his
              closeness and respect for the Mughals family and secondly, to
              reinforce Jahangir's image.

              {" "}
              Finally, one outstanding feature of the painting is its technique.
              Balchand aimed at creating a specific mood in every of his
              paintings and in this case it was a stately and solemn one. He
              achieved it by creating a misty background enhanced with soft
              colors and showering the Jahangir and Akbar with heavenly light.
              As mentioned before, he placed more emphasis on the object and
              less on the intimately imperial settings. He was observative and
              took note of people's preferences in his works.He, therefore,
              skillfully brushed his outfits in his personal colors. However,
              even with the customized characterizations, he still exercised
              restrain not to overemphasize. In this particular painting,
              Balchand considered Akbar's sensitivity to the sweetness of
              expressions. Even though he gave both of them formal features, he
              rendered the veins on Akbar’s hand more meticulously. Furthermore,
              he subtly highlighted Akbar’s rich brown coat with gold powder..
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, Balchand’s painting of Jahangir and his father was
              mainly meant to pass a message of reconciliation. Jahangir had
              spent a fair amount of time at loggerheads with his father, and so
              did his son with him when he became emperor. However, out of
              respect and closeness to the Mughals, Balchand addressed the issue
              in his painting. Furthermore, he represented the Mughals' love for
              painting besides showing his skillfulness in detail and
              observation.
