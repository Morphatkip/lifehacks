                Topic: Explain the relation between the Mexican-American
                community and the idea of the American Dream. How was the
                community supposed to accomplish this? What obstacles stood in
                the way?

                James Truslow Adams takes the credit for coining the words “the
                American Dream.” In his book The Epic of America, he explains it
                as “… a dream of a land in which life should be better and
                richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each
                according to ability or achievement…” (Adams, no pg.). James
                Truslow Adams visualized a kind of society with minimal
                restrictions on social class mobility. In his idea of the
                American dream, every individual has an equal chance to succeed
                regardless of their origin as long as they can exploit their
                full potential. Many American citizens believe that the United
                States has realized some fraction of the dream and continues
                hoping to achieve it fully (Cid, p. 3). The Mexican-American
                community in the United States has been on the increase over
                time to pursue the same dream. Despite the high hopes the
                community has on the American Dream, it has proven to be a
                challenging ride. Hence, although the American Dream has
                enticing promises, it does not come easy to the Mexican-American
                community.

                The American Dream has gained global fame thanks to television
                and social media platforms. It promises excellent opportunities
                to grow and achieve greater social and economic status provided
                one is prepared to work hard. These huge promises have caused
                immigration, both legal and illegal, into the United States. A
                significant percentage of the Mexican-American community
                constitutes immigrants, mostly from Mexico and Guatemala. Most
                Mexican-Americans perceived owning a house as the attainment of
                the American Dream, and as such, that was their primary
                objective (Cid, p. 12). A few, however, had higher objectives.
                Whereas the immigrants were willing to do anything to realize
                the dream, the Americans noticed their work ethic and
                determination. They, therefore, over-utilized them or, as Cid
                says, Americanized them (p. 11). It hence became difficult for
                the Mexican-American community to achieve their objective. The
                Mexican-American community faced a myriad of other barriers in
                this “land of opportunity.”

                Legal status was and still is the biggest problem for the
                Mexican-American community. It makes most of the community
                members to live in hiding and make do with low paying jobs. They
                would not dare complain even where their rights get violated to
                avoid getting into the spotlight (Alba, no pg.). Unfortunately,
                the undocumented status at times encroaches into the second
                generation and results in children's schooling but not being
                legible to work. Clearly, in this state, one cannot make any
                progress in their socio-economic situation. They get resigned to
                waiting and hoping that the system relaxes some regulations. In
                worse case scenarios, the affected people engage in illicit
                activities to make ends meet (Albrego & Gonzales, no pg.). From
                those mentioned above, the American Dream can only remain to be
                a dream to the concerned.

                Racial prejudice is another issue facing the Mexican-American
                community. Americans consider them an inferior group and not
                worthy of the American Dream (Cid, no pg.). As a result, the
                southern border with Mexico has more restrictions and
                ill-treatment than the northern with Canada. The discrimination
                goes down to the educational institutions. For instance, in
                Texas, where most Mexican-Americans occupied, they got placed in
                underfunded schools (Alba, no pg.). Without quality education,
                they had no chance to compete favorably and pursue their
                objectives. The community's chance of experiencing the American
                Dream could not be easier.

                In conclusion, as a nation, the United States has continued to
                flourish and improve economically and socially. The federal
                government has gotten to a place where even animals have rights.
                On the other hand, Latino American countries, including Mexico,
                continue to wallow in instability, making their citizens long
                migrate to the "land of opportunity." The United States also
                promises opportunities to the willing, making it all the more
                enticing. However, there are stringent measures on immigration,
                leading to most people moving in illegally. Furthermore, varying
                law enforcement systems have made it easier for undocumented
                people to live in the United States for as long as possible
                (Cid, p. 9). Taking all the aforementioned into consideration,
                it could take an eternity for the Mexican-American community to
                fully realize the American Dream.

                {" "}
                Before the European settlers moved into the present-day United
                States, the natives had a fairly organized society. There were
                many tribes, most of them Indian, already inhabiting the region.
                The notable ones were Delaware and the Shawnee and the Iroquois
                Confederacy that comprised five Iroquois speaking tribes. The
                two Delaware and Shawnee tribes occupied present-day West
                Virginia while the Confederacy had its base in present-day New
                York (“Native American Clashes With European Settlers”).
                Conflicts were a common occurrence, especially since the
                Iroquois Confederacy exercised control over the region. However,
                the Europeans' arrival would escalate the conflicts to new
                levels and lead the natives to a path of independence.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Most native tribes welcomed the Europeans openly as they looked
                forward to acquiring weapons through trade with them. The
                different groups of European settlers each came with specific
                motives. While the French were mainly interested in trade, the
                British were concerned with settling on the frontier (“Native
                American Clashes With European Settlers”). The natives put
                themselves in the face of the conflict by playing the European
                powers. They would sign trade treaties with each separately,
                promising not to work with the other. Eventually, wars became
                inevitable, and the native Americans had to take sides. Most of
                them sided with the French, and after the British emerged
                victorious, they had made an enemy.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The European settlers signed treaties that allowed them to
                acquire land, thereby forcing the natives to shift westwards.
                The locals agreed easily to the treaties because they did not
                have a "private property" concept about land. Therefore, they
                did not expect the European settlers to have exclusive land
                usage because they owned land communally. As a result, more land
                conflicts ensued, and the natives were always on the losing end.
                They would not be allowed to move further west by the British
                forces. The conflicts eventually led to wars, the biggest of
                all, being the Revolutionary war that saw the natives gain
                independence. The series of wars the natives got exposed to
                caused them to desire independence, and hence, they fought for
                it.

                {" "}
                The native Americans had an organized system of governance that
                influenced the early government system after independence. The
                Iroquois Confederacy had a participatory democracy government
                with three arms: the legislature, executive and judiciary
                (“Native American Influences On American Government”). The
                Iroquois Confederacy also had a constitution named The Great Law
                of Peace (“Native American Influences On American Government”).
                It had 117 articles and covered important governing aspects,
                including the rights and responsibilities of each member tribe.
                This constitution's design is what guided the drafters of the
                first United States constitution: Benjamin Franklin, George
                Washington and Thomas Jefferson (“Native American Influences On
                American Government”). The Iroquois Confederacy also had a flag
                that symbolized the unity of the tribes. Some of the symbols of
                the flag became adopted into the first American flag as national
                symbols.
              </p>
              <p>
                In conclusion, the native Americans, despite suffering huge
                losses from the arrival of European settlers, also reaped huge
                benefits. Even though they had conflicts before, they were minor
                and involved issues such as hunting rights to regions. They got
                into conflicts with European settlers over land ownership but
                initially did not have the strength to confront them. The
                trading activities with the Europeans paid off as they gained
                access to weapons. Furthermore, taking sides in the French and
                Indian wars enabled them to gain experience in war.{" "}
