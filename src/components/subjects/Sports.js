                The article by Derek Van Rheenen asserts the exploitation in
                college sports. The claims in exploitation are made by focusing
                on race, revenue, and educational reward. It argues that
                exploitation is basically an ethical build perceived as an out
                of line trade between two parties. Notions of Marxist and
                neoclassical analyze exploitation based on revenue. This is to
                define the terms commodification, marginal revenue product, and
                surplus. It is hard to correlate a college degree with the
                revenue that a student will generate when playing for the
                college. The majority of college athletes are composed of black
                athletes. This portrays a feature of racial and social
                divisions. On the contrary, black college students have a lower
                graduation rate. This paper reviews these factors outlined by
                Derek Van Rheenen.

                From the article perspective, exploitation is a
                moral-philosophical concept. It is argued to be a situation
                where one party gets an out of line and gratuitous advantage
                from its exchanges or associations with others (Wertheimer,
                1996). The article argues that one can absolutely contend that
                colleges and universities get unmerited advantages from
                students’ athletes. This is by utilizing their talents with the
                sole aim of generating income and public fame. This kind of
                association can be termed as exploitive. This question the
                geniuses of colleges' and universities' policy of being a
                non-profit organization.{" "}

                From a Marxist viewpoint, exploitation is quantifiable through
                the estimation of surplus worth. The wages of workers are
                usually less than the net worth of their input. The
                uncompensated effort is what is termed as surplus. The article
                argues that an athlete's achievement is commodified when it is
                changed into a product and traded on the market for its equal
                worth, expressed in money. The college athlete receives no
                workers compensation, the profit earned is not taxable, and the
                institutions escape scrutiny as illegal business as the athletes
                are considered amateurs. The college directors are utilizing the
                ideal of unprofessional quality as an exploitive ideology.

                Van Rheenen asserts exploitation in education rewards. This
                argument focuses on the quality of education provided to college
                athletes who are on revenue-generating teams. It expounds on the
                fact that few black’s athletes graduate (Lapchick, 2010). The
                majority of colleges and institutions and colleges admit black
                students due to their talent in the sport. The institutions will
                ignore their educational needs; thus, a poor-quality education
                is offered. When these students graduate, there are claims that
                exploitation has still occurred due to a degree in a field of
                little value.

                Racial imbalances and social and cultural exploitation occur
                when a certain race graduate at a higher rate due to an
                inequality caused by the institution. As argued by van Rheenen,
                this scenario particularly occurs when schools and colleges
                excessively select and admit black male school athletes into
                income-producing groups. They will be a drop in the performance
                of the black race as compared to the non-black. The black
                athlete will feel demeaned. This is because they are only
                celebrated for their physical contribution rather than their
                mind contribution, which is the sole purpose of school. It makes
                them feel exploited by the school.

                With the basis that Van Rheenes has laid on the existence of
                exploitation in college sports, the matter cannot be neglected.
                The exploitation has a negative emotional effect on the victims.
                Furthermore, the quality of education offered by the colleges
                will deem to decrease gradually. Educational institutions will
                tend to focus more on commercializing sports events, which will
                offer an easy alternative to making a profit. Collages ought to
                operate in the core reason for its existence. This will ensure
                that no exploitation occurs.

                In conclusion, the article sheds light on the exploitation that
                exists in American higher education sports. The talents of a
                college athlete are exploited by colleges and universities,
                which utilizes it to make a profit. The college athletes are
                considered amateurs. Due to this, they do not receive benefits
                like the normal working class. In turn, the institutions' profit
                is not entitled to taxation and scrutiny as illegal businesses.
                This is utilizing the unprofessional quality as an exploitive
                ideology. The black athlete feels also exploited as they are
                solely celebrated for their sporting prowess, contrary to the
                reason for learning. To combat this issue, colleges ought to
                ensure they operate within the main reason for its existence.
