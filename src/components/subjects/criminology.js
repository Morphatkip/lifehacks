                A situation to be termed as an ethical dilemma must meet three
                conditions; The first condition happens in a case where an
                individual must settle on a choice about which strategy is
                ideal. The second condition for the moral dilemma is that there
                must be various game-plans to look over and the third is that
                regardless of what approach is taken, some ethical standards are
                undermined. As such, there is no ideal arrangement (Allen). This
                paper explores a court dilemma in narration between the correct
                event that leads to an arrest and a slight alteration of the
                events.

                In the given case, the defendant is a drug trafficker. This is a
                fact that can be proven by the trade between the defender and
                the undercover police. As a responsible law enforcement officer,
                the best cause of action was apprehending the culprit. The
                dilemma occurs in that the bags of drugs were found on the
                ground during the chase, and it was a reasonable assumption to
                take that it belonged to the defendant since there was no one
                else in sight. Mentioning this to the defense attorney, they
                will be a solid ground of defense. The best cause of action will
                be to stick to the earlier version that the defendant threw down
                glassine envelops before the arrest. This will be for the better
                since the illicit trafficking of drugs to society will be
                reduced, and no injustice has been done since it is a fact that
                the defendant was involved in the business.

                {" "}
                In conclusion, this situation's ethical dilemma is between
                changing or telling the authentic narration of how the arrest of
                a drug peddler suspect occurred to facilitate a quicker arrival
                to justice being done. The false version of the events is a
                viable option.

            <Accordion.Header>Reus of Battery</Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              <p>
                Battery is a common-law offense almost related to assault. It
                lacks a precise legislative definition, but there are several
                acceptable explanations. One popular definition is it is an
                offensive and unlawful contact unconsented by the victim
                ("Assault and Battery"). Lord Steyn in R vs. Ireland defines
                battery as "unlawful application of force by the defendant upon
                the victim" ("Battery"). The use of force is the actus reus of
                battery, while the intent is the mental element – mens rea. From
                the first definition above, it is worth noting that the
                defendant does not necessarily have to injure the victim.
                Furthermore, the force or contact does not have to be direct.
                For instance, throwing a ball at someone and injuring them on
                the head with it is a case of battery. However, recently there
                are revisions to laws in many countries that only convict one of
                battery if the force causes an injury or if the contact is
                offensive. In the above example, therefore, if the ball does not
                cause injury, then it is not a battery offense. On the other
                hand, if someone touches an opposite gender's genitals without
                consent, it is offensive regardless of whether it causes harm.
                Hence it becomes a battery offense. Therefore, battery involves
                either contact or force that is either offensive or harmful or
                both.
              </p>
              <p>
                The physical element of battery – the actus reus – relates to
                its definition. The use of force, as mentioned earlier, is the
                physical element of battery. There are three key words
                considered: "application," "unlawful," and a controversial
                "physical force" ("Battery"). The first keyword illuminates that
                the force applied can either be direct or indirect, as mentioned
                earlier. The second directs that the defendant should not be
                legally excusable for using the force in the conducted act. An
                example of a lawful excuse is when one has to defend themselves
                or when a parent punishes a child 'reasonably.' Finally, the
                concept of physical force describes any unlawful and offensive
                contact. Even though the term seems to suggest a high degree of
                force, it covers even the lightest touch as long as it is
                without approval and not lawfully excusable ("Battery"). In
                contrast, whereas battery entails unlawful use of force, murder
                involves unlawful killing. The actus reus for murder is the
                "unlawful killing" of a "human being" "under the Queen's peace"
                ("The Law of Murder").

              <p>
                {" "}
                The first keyword separates legal killings, such as doctors
                having to withdraw care, from unlawful ones. The second allows
                the defendant's conviction only if the victim was a human being
                and explains at what point one stops to be a human being.
                Finally, the last concept excludes foreigners' killing during
                war ("The Law of Murder"). From the preceding, the major
                similarity between the two is that the law presides over what is
                acceptable and what is prohibited.
              </p>

                {" "}
                Actus reus, in most cases, comprises four elements: conduct,
                consequences, circumstances, and causation ("Topic 1: Definition
                and Principles of Crime| Lawlessons.Ca"). Conduct refers to the
                act or sometimes omission to an act. Consequences are the
                results of the act. Circumstances refer to the situations under
                which the act becomes a crime. Causation is the validation that
                the conduct led to the consequence. The physical elements of
                murder and battery have huge differences. The first difference
                is in the conduct as it leads to different outcomes or
                consequences in each. The actus reus of murder can only have one
                consequence – killing. On the other hand, the actus reus of
                battery may or may not have a consequence. For instance, hitting
                someone with a baseball bat would most likely result in injury
                as a consequence. However, touching someone's genitalia will not
                have any consequence. Hence, while the actus reus of murder must
                have a consequence, the actus reus of battery does not have to
                have one.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The third element: circumstances, looks into the situations
                making the conduct become the stated crime. For battery, contact
                is the primary consideration under this element. There are two
                things in consideration: hostility or recklessness and
                unlawfulness. Application of force upon someone amounts to
                hostile touching and is also unlawful when it is without
                consent. For instance, pinning someone against the wall is
                aggressive contact, and when they did not approve it, it is
                unlawful. However, pinning a lover against the wall regardless
                of how aggressive the contact is, is not battery because there
                is mutual consent. The overarching idea when looking at the
                circumstances surrounding the act is that it must have been
                voluntary. Actions in self-defense and those in the course of
                preventing a worse consequence do not amount to battery.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Circumstances in actus reus of murder differ from those of
                battery, mainly because the latter must have a consequence. The
                first circumstance, therefore, is the presence or absence of an
                alibi ("What Are the Defences to Murder?"). An absence would
                place the defendant in the scene of the killing and hence, a
                suspect. Like battery, murder must result from a voluntary act.
                Hence, the defendant's mental state at the time of the
                occurrence is subject to review to ensure there was no mental
                illness. Furthermore, there should be proof that the killing was
                not prompted by pressure: it was not out of duress, for example,
                death threats. Finally, the victim must be a human being to
                qualify it to be a murder. A person only ceases to be a human
                being when their brain stem stops functioning ("The Law of
                Murder"). It does not matter whether there is artificial
                equipment sustaining them.
