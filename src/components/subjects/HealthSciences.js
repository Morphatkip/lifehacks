                Doctor-patient confidentiality is a legal concept. It protects
                communication between patient and doctor from being disclosed to
                third parties. Breaching confidentiality occurs when a patient’s
                record is viewed by a third party. These breaches are potential
                common when medical notes are left visible, hacking of hospital
                computers and poor disposal methods of medical records. Failure
                to maintain this venerable obligation may result in suboptimal
                treatment (Confidentiality and health records toolkit, 2020).
                However, in modern medical world breach of confidentiality may
                be allowed in some situations. General Medical council specifies
                the legitimate exceptions. These are: disclosure with content,
                disclosure required by law and disclosure in the public
                interest. This paper discusses on how breach of confidentiality
                should be applied to BG a patient who is dying from AIDS-related
                disease.

                Making a disclosure with the patient’s consent is the most
                common reason for revealing confidential details. A doctor is
                relieved from the duty of confidence when a patient consents the
                record be revealed. Multi-disciplinary team is another instance
                where the patient records can be relieved. In this situation
                members of a health care are obliged to share the patient’s data
                to provide optimal care. Children are also allowed to withhold
                sensitive information from their parents but if the child is at
                risk the doctor is to report the case to relevant authorities.
                The mature minor’s right of confidentiality is permitted when is
                deemed in their best interest (McHale).

                In critical care setting patient’s data can be disclosed to
                relatives, friends, or third parties. It will be unreasonable
                not to disclose information to the next of keen when the patient
                is seriously ill. Although there is no a clear legal definition
                of next keen, under section 26b of the Mental Act 1983 it state
                that the patient’s husband or wife, takes precedence for taking
                responsibility for the patient in the context of mental illness.
                The partner remains the next of keen unless they are divorced.
                The third parties referred in this case are employers, insurance
                companies, and lawyers. Other breach of confidentiality
                guidelines includes, public crime ad judicial process

                . BG appointed her boyfriend to be her medical health care
                proxy. Since this is a critical care setting where the patient
                is in a comma, the medical team should disclose BG’s health
                record to her boyfriend. This will give BG’s boyfriend a legal
                right to make decisions on behalf of BG as he is the health care
                proxy. He has the liberty to either disclose the health

                In conclusion the guidelines of breaching confidentiality
                include: making a disclosure with patients consent,
                multi-disciplinary decision, and disclosure to relatives or
                friends due to patient critical conditions, judicial proceedings
                and prevention of crime. Applying these guidelines to BG’s case,
                the information has to be revealed to her boyfriend.

                Ethical issue in medical arises when an absolute moral standard
                of medical records brings a conflict. The conflict erupts
                between the hospital and an individual or other related third
                party. Medical health records are usually put in place to
                facilitate the patient's care and enhance the patient and the
                physician's relationship. The ethical issues in electronic
                medical records are confidentiality and privacy and security
                breaches. This paper will focus on the above ethical issues
                related to electronic medical records and the importance of

                As asserted by Richard Rognehaugh(1999) privacy is a right where
                individuals are at liberty to conceal information about
                themselves; the freedom of one to be left alone from
                surveillance and interference from an organization, government
                or other individuals. A patient's information should only be
                disclosed to a third party with the patient's consent or as per
                required by the law. If the patient is underage, mentally
                incapacitated, or in a critical health condition, the decision
                on sharing the information should be made by the legal guardian
                or a legal representative of the patient. The patient records'
                electronic access should be based on the role-based privileges,

                Security breaches threaten the privacy of a patient. The

                Howard University hospital portrayed that inadequate data
                security can affect many patients. A hospital security key's
                decryption will give access to almost all the patient's data in
                a particular hospital. Security measures such as intrusion
                detection software, antivirus software and firewalls must be
                incorporated in such systems to ensure data integrity (Ozair et

                The ethical issues in medical records help resolve disputes
                between physicians, patients, family and other parties. Mostly
                the conflicts that arise are influenced by emotion which clouds
                the judgment of the parties involved. The ethical issue adds
                dimension to help arrive at a rationale agreement. Ethical
                issues also maintain the respect of the patient. The medical
                team in charge of the records will respect the patients as long
                as no ethical missteps occur (What Is Medical Ethics, and Why Is
                It Important?,2021).

                ethical issues in electronic hospital records are
                confidentiality and privacy and breach of information. A

                The symbol that is used to denote Gamma radiation is the Greek
                symbol γ. The rays can be thought of as a Photon (packet of
                electromagnetic radiation) emanating from radioactive decay of
                radionuclides' nucleus. The radiation is from radioisotopes of
                uranium, thorium, and actinium when they undergo natural decay.
                Radioisotopes from potassium-40 and carbon-14 also emit Gamma
                rays. In the Electromagnetic spectrum, which is composed of
                radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet,
                X-rays, and gamma rays, Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength
                in the electromagnetic spectra and also the highest energy3. The
                effect of gamma rays are; causes cancer, destroy living cells,
                and produce gene mutation. This essay explores gamma radiation:
                effects, mode of movement, hazard sources, and control measures.

                Gamma rays travel from its source as a packet of electromagnetic
                radiation. It can displace electron out of particles, a cycle
                known as ionization, as it possesses so much energy. Gamma-ray
                is a type of Ionization radiation. It influences the atoms in
                living things, posing a health risk by changing DNA genes, and
                damaging tissues1.

                The damage of Gamma radiation to cells can be brought by
                indirect or direct radiation activity to the DNA particles. In
                direct activity, radiation hits the DNA particle directly. The
                changes in the cell will cause an alteration or even death. The
                surviving cell later instigate carcinogens or different
                abnormalities. If it hits the cell indirectly, the radiation
                hits the water atoms, the significant constituent of the cell,
                and other natural particles in the cell. This will lead to
                reactions that produce free radicals, for example, alkoxy and
                hydroxyl. Such radicals have unpaired electrons in their
                structure. The unpaired electrons are highly reactive, thus
                react with DNA particles to cause subatomic auxiliary harm. It
                has been discovered that most of the radiation-actuated harm
                results from indirect action of radiation since water
                establishes almost 70 % of the composition of the cell6.

                When Gamma radiation penetrates through the human body, either
                the cell will be killed, or the blueprint of the DNA changed.
                Cancer will develop when the blueprint of the DNA is altered3.
                The cell will lose control of cell division, and it starts
                dividing uncontrollably. This impact will mostly not be visible
                for a long time. Cancer incited by radiation does not vary from
                cancer from other causes. Typically, there is no primary method
                to quantify the pace of cancer that resulted from radiation. The
                research on it is complicated by the assortment of cancer, which
                differs in radio sensitivity.

                Gamma radiation may cause gene mutation. Gene mutation is a
                permanent change in the sequence of DNA that builds the gene.
                The mutation can alter a single DNA block or the entire segment
                of a chromosome with many genes. The effect takes place where
                the Gamma radiation alters the blueprint of the germ cell.
                Changes in germ cells, ova, and sperm can be transferred to the
                future generation and are subsequently called hereditable or
                genetic effects4. Hereditary impacts may not show up until
                countless ages later. The hereditary transformation of radiation
                does not deliver the apparent monsters of sci-fi; it creates a
                more net worthy recurrence of similar changes that happen
                ceaselessly and unexpectedly in nature.

                Gamma rays are produced by objects at a very high temperature
                and have high energy in the universe. Examples of this object
                are supernova explosions, neutron stars, and regions around the
                black hole. On earth, they are generated by lightning, nuclear
                explosion, and activity of radioactivity decay. On the contrary
                to X-rays and optical light, mirrors cannot reflect gamma rays.
                The wavelength of Gamma rays is short and penetrates through
                most particles it can even pass through the atoms of the
                detector. Crystal blocks are closely packed in a Gamma-ray
                detector. The electrons in the crystals collide with the rays of
                the atom as they pass through it. This detection technique is
                known as Compton scattering. These collisions create charged
                particles and the sensor can detect it3.

                In conclusion, the radiation that has been explored is Gamma
                radiation. Gamma radiation is a packet of electromagnetic
                radiation that emanates from the radioactive decay of
                radionuclides' nucleus. The rays have the shortest waves in
                electromagnetic spectra and also the highest penetrating power.
                It travels from the source as a packet of electromagnetic
                radiation. When a body is exposed to the rays, it can cause gene
                mutation, cancerous cell growth, or kill the cell. The effect of
                the rays can be either directly or indirectly. In direct effect,
                the rays strike the cell directly, while in indirect effect
                other molecules in the body are hit by the rays. The molecules
                will be altered and, in turn, react with the cell. The
                International Commission on Radiological Protection has put in
                place three principles to combat the radiation. The principle
                are the Principle of optimization, the principle of limitation
                and the principle of justification.

                Fenton and Biederman (2014) define healthcare informatics as, “a
                field of information science concerned with the management of
                all aspects of health data information through the application
                of computer and computer technology.” Health data comes in
                different forms and sizes, and even with technological
                advancements, improving the healthcare of patients is not a
                guarantee. There is need to sort the data and determine what is
                meaningful in the short-term and long-term. Electronic health
                records (EHRs) have gradually replaced the traditional
                paper-based systems, but they have their associated milestones.
                Despite making data easier to store, retrieve, and transmit,
                they are proving more difficult to handle since human beings
                cannot match their pace. That is where the health informatics
                discipline has proven to be invaluable. It has applied
                technology in organizing, analyzing, managing, and making use of
                information to improve healthcare (Abstract Book, 2014).

                Medical informatics is a crucial field in medicine and other
                health sciences. Since its inception in the mid-20th century, it
                has aimed at improving the quality of healthcare. Its primary
                objectives have always been to come up with levels and
                procedures in clinical care that heighten EHRs. The way to
                achieve this is by attempting to simplify the process of
                information management. The impression medical informatics has
                had so far on quality care is evident. It has significantly cut
                the wait times during admittance. Furthermore, it has lessened
                the doubling of tests (Abstract Book, 2014). Since it eases the
                storing and generation of data by electronic means, there is
                more data for analysis and hence, better management of public
                health (Abstract Book, 2014).

                {" "}
                However, there is no shortage of problems associated with the
                implementation of the system and hence, the provision of quality
                healthcare. Even though a lot of information is available for
                analysis, the computerized systems that hold the volumes of data
                require human interaction. Computers have the ability to sort a
                lot of data but cannot distinguish between bad data and
                meaningful data. On the other hand, the human capacity to handle
                such volumes has not evolved as much. Furthermore, healthcare
                specialists only know their job do not have a deeper
                understanding of technological systems and data science. These
                challenges, among others, including costs, are hindrances to the
                implementation of the reforms in the field. Before the
                realization of any significant improvement in the
                implementation, addressing the challenges should be the
                priority. One big step most governments are taking in addressing
                the challenges is providing incentives to facilitate meaningful
                use of EHRs. The United States, for instance, through the Center
                for Medicare and Medicaid Services, makes disbursements to a
                number of providers.

                From the above mentioned, it is clear that medical informatics
                employ technological tools to improve patient care. In doing so,
                medical informatics have some goals to achieve. First is
                consolidating the clinical data of patients. Currently, patients
                rarely stick to one doctor or health center, and not all health
                professionals apply the same treatment means. However, digital
                consolidation of patient data can help doctors know the latest
                treatments their peers are using. Furthermore, it will enable
                health professionals to track a patient's progress easily,
                regardless of where they had taken their treatment before. The
                second goal is to avail new discoveries and inventions for
                patient care ("Goals | Medical Informatics Initiative," n.d.).
                Currently, it takes time for emerging trends to be available
                universally. However, with HER implementation, medical
                informatics aims to quickly bring discoveries to the table.

                In conclusion, the management of information is important in
                every profession but more so in healthcare since it involves
                human lives. New treatments are quickly evolving, and it is
                important to keep track of the changes and use them as a guide
                to future modalities. Human beings have limitations and hence
                cannot manage to process and interpret changes quickly. Managing
                information, therefore, apart from providing guidance, also
                serves as provides references.
