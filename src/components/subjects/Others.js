                What we see and cooperate with is in color, and this
                incorporates both natural and built environments. In daily
                lives, routine majority of what human beings assimilate via the
                sense is visual. Nonetheless, color accomplishes beyond just
                giving human being information about the world; it also affects
                how they feel. There is a disparity in the color lexicon, color
                perception, and color preference in gender, women and men. The
                hypothesis used in this paper is that male and female perception
                of color is different.

                This research explores the dimension of color that is hue,
                saturation, and brightness. It utilizes the dimension in
                investigating the effects that it has on gender (women and men).
                The reference used is by Khoum (2020), Green (1995), and Keller
                (1976) cited in details in the reference section. The reason for
                choosing this research topic was the statement commonly used
                that 'men are color blind'. Having the same notion, it is
                worthwhile proving it from written work.

              <h1>Color perception</h1>
              <p>
                It is widely accepted that women have a more extensive color
                vocabulary than men. In rare occasions, men's conversations
                entail the mention of color like azure, periwinkle, and so
                forth. Green (1995) conducted research to identify the color
                vocabulary of college students. They were approached to
                distinguish the shades of 21 shading chips. The outcomes
                indicated that ladies perceived more detailed colors than men
                essentially. Discoveries additionally showed that gender various
                reactions in shading identification might be ascribed to a
                distinction in the socialization.

                The visualization of color is affected by three dimensions;
                brightness, hue, and saturation. Brightness portrays how a color
                emanates or mirrors light. Hue is the color itself, for example,
                green, yellow, blue, and red. Saturation can be comprehended as
                the profundity of the shading.

                Steffens (2020) researched to determine the color perception in
                women and men. In the research, Steffens requested a group
                consisting of men and women to separate the hue of shading and
                allot a rate to blue, green, yellow, and red. The outcomes
                portrayed that ladies were more skilled at recognizing
                ultra-fine degrees of colors than were men. This variation was
                well portrayed in the center of the color spectrum. With shades
                that were mostly green or yellow, ladies had the option to
                recognize little contrasts between colors that seemed to be
                indistinguishable from men. The research asserted that
                marginally longer frequencies of light are needed for men to be
                able to make an exact distinguishment as ladies; the hues that
                men identified as yellow ladies identified it as orange.

                The research also portrayed that men were superior to ladies at
                seeing dull bars gleaming on a screen. The brightness changes
                are perceived better by men, which is a skill utilized in
                recognizing a face or perusing a letter on an eye outline. This
                impact was expanded as the bars were reduced in size, proposing
                that men are touchier to fine subtleties and quick movement than
                ladies.

                {" "}
                Color affects the emotion of men and women differently (Kuller,
                1976). Pulses recorded in a dim room are quicker than in a
                bright room. Besides, in a dim room, men are found to have a
                high-pressure response than ladies. Men additionally become more
                exhausted than ladies. The mental relaxation of ladies in a dim
                room is high than that of men (Khouw, 2020).

                Several theories have been developed to explain the disparity in
                perception of color among gender. According to biology,
                testosterone receptor in men is more than in women in the
                cerebral cortex's visual region. Input from specific sets of
                neurons located in the primary visual cortex measures
                Brightness, hue, and saturation. The high number of women's
                receptors than men attributes to the disparity in color
                perception (Steffens, 2020).
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                One theory is dated back to the hunters and gathers obligations.
                Men had to recognize the difference between prey and predators
                from afar, while ladies might have developed a short proximity
                vision from scrounging and gathering. It is related to the
                modern world where women and men's activities are different;
                hence, the vision is an adaptation of the environment. Further
                detailed research in this theory is important (Steffens, 2020).
              </p>
              <h1>Conclusion</h1>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The researched articles proved that there is a disparity in
                color perception among men and women. The three dimensions of
                color used in analyzing the disparity are hue, brightness, and
                saturation. Research has found out that marginally longer
                frequencies of light are needed for men to make an exact
                distinguishment of color as ladies. The pressure of men in a dim
                room is higher than that of ladies in the same room. The
                strength of men in color is found in distinguishing shades of
                moving or flickering light. The biological explanation of the
                disparity is that men have more testosterone receptors than
                ladies in the cerebral cortex's visual region.

                The united nations categorize homelessness into two; absolute
                homelessness and relative homelessness. Absolute homelessness
                describes the state of individuals without actual asylum who
                find their shelter outside in abandoned structures, vehicles, or
                other places that are not fit for humans to reside. Relative
                homelessness portrays the state of an individual who has an
                actual house; however, one does not meet fundamental wellbeing
                and security; these include individual security, affordability,
                the security of tenure, availability of clean water and
                sanitation, and protection from the elements. In this essay, the
                homeless are taken as the people staying in places set aside for
                homeless people and people who are considered absolute homeless.
                The two definitions are usually used in health-related
                exploration (Hwang & Stephen). Coronavirus is a highly
                contagious respiratory disease whose effect has been felt
                worldwide. This essay explores homelessness and its relation to
                Coronavirus effects.

                According to Karl Max, homelessness can be understood by basing
                it on the conflict theory. The conflict theory asserts that
                there is always an unending conflict due to the scarcity of
                resources (Tumin and Melvin). Social order ought to be kept by
                consensus and conformity, but the theory emphasizes that it is
                kept by domination and power.
              </p>
              <p>
                The conflict theory suggests that the cause of homelessness is
                capitalism. Under the theory, only two classes exist, the
                proletariat and bourgeoisie. It further explains that
                entrepreneurs exploit their laborers, subsequently denying them
                fundamental human requirements like food and haven; these
                laborers are under the notion that they are dealt with fairly.
                They subliminally depend on entrepreneurs to take care of them.
                It proposes that the bourgeoisie do not have the common's
                wellbeing as the main priority, and their objective is to gain
                wealth using any means.

                {" "}
                The conflict theory contends that abundance is procured through
                challenging work, assurance, and in particular, education in a
                capitalist society. Those in an ideal situation considers the
                homeless and needy as unmotivated, uninformed, and individuals
                dependent on charity. Karl Marx himself accepted that this
                perspective was bogus cognizance. Conflict theory proposes that
                social issues like homelessness are an immediate aftereffect of
                a people's weaknesses and blemishes as a part of their character
                instead of defects in the general public itself. One can utilize
                this theory to clarify homelessness and capitalism, considering
                that constant outrage is held by people who are less fortunate
                than those in a place of abundance and budgetary solace and
                steadiness. Subsequently, nations are overwhelmed by the elite
                group who acquire control through rivalry and battles they have
                won (Frances).

                The French sociologist Emile Durkheim sheds some light on the
                social issue of homelessness. The prosperity of a society is
                dependent on the ‘functional necessity’ of inequality. Over the
                most recent couple of years, sociological perspectives on
                destitution have been centered around social structures to
                clarify the current and expanding presence of neediness. For
                quite a long time, the penchant for deciding a person as liable
                for their difficulties has been a typical subject. This subject
                of the undeserving poor is viewed as a component of the ethical
                failings deciphered as a primary cause of homelessness. Today,
                the contention of the welfare framework being answerable for
                expanding and supporting its client’s reliance is a famous one.
                Sociologist regularly utilizes detailed verification to contend
                against these explanations for poverty and homelessness. They
                take the opportunities accessible to the individual to
                understand their circumstance (Frances).

                The ongoing Coronavirus pandemic has made it more evident than
                any other time that housing and wellbeing are characteristically
                interlinked. Health is majorly dependent on housing, but it is
                rarely incorporated in health policies. During the Coronavirus
                pandemic, where we are encouraged to remain at home in
                isolation, it becomes evident that it is the fundamental
                wellbeing setting in our lives. One cannot make the most of

                influenced by disability and poor health. The commonness of
                respiratory infection among the homeless populace is high. On
                the off chance that they contract COVID-19, there are at a high

                each group. Homeless individuals should be prioritized for
                testing in all nations, and this requires a focus on outreach.
                This sort of program is fundamental for them and is especially

                have expanded supposed 'winter programs' to avoid closing
                shelters, which will force individuals to seek shelter on the
                street. Basic social services are kept up regardless of
                lock-down measures in numerous nations, for instance, in Italy.
                Everyday activities in shelters, where shared offices and
                residences are ordinary, make it practically difficult to

                More of these activities that are aimed at expanding the shelter

                groups who acquire control through rivalry and battles. Relating
                it to COVID-19, the net worth of some millionaires has increased
                by a significant margin. JeffBezos net worth rise by $48

                platform has been a viable option for students to continue with
                their education online. It gives a sense of good to the users,
                but on the other end, it requires data that can be bought from
                service providers. It increases over the cost of education, and
                the total cost is passed on to guardians. Ironically most of the
                graduates who finished their schooling in the coronavirus period
                are left jobless as most industries reduced the number of
                employees. If the situation is not remedied, it might exacerbate
                the poverty situation leading to further homelessness.

                In conclusion, homelessness can be categorized into absolute and
                relative. The homelessness utilized in this essay is absolute.
                It describes the state of individuals without actual asylum who
                find their shelter outside in abandoned structures. The conflict
                theory is used to explain homelessness from a sociological point
                of view. It asserts that social order is maintained by power and
                dominion. A model of the United Kingdom's data is used to
                analyze the Corona virus's effect on the homeless. The
                homelessness is more vulnerable to Coronavirus due to the
                prevalence of conditions unfit for humans around them. The
                European Federation of National organization has several
                recommendations that aim to improve homelessness conditions. The
                increased wealth of some millionaires in the world has proven
                the conflict theory, which asserts that social order is
                maintained by power and dominion rather than by consensus and
                dominion.

                Carnegie (2011) takes the definition of persuasion and influence
                from Aristotle’s (384-322BC) perspective. As per the definition,
                effective influencers endeavour to mix three measures to
                accomplish the objective of moving individuals from X to Y:
                first, ethos identifies with the source validity of the
                influencer and their truthfulness that radiates from them;
                second, pathos identifies with the lending of the feelings in
                others, all in all, to have sympathy and lastly logos which
                alludes to the genuine words utilized by the influencer.
                Successful influencing intends to show open regards for the
                qualities, needs and wants of others, confirm these with them
                and afterwards offer these to them in a commonly gainful bundle.
                (Carnegie, 2011). Viable influencers leave others somewhat good
                after every communication with them. Persuasion skills can be
                applied generally and independent of the business managers are
                operating. This paper explores Consistency and authority as
                persuasive influence techniques used in a managerial.

                Consistency explores the desire that human beings want to be
                consistent. Once they have focused on something, they are more
                disposed to proceed with it. This is particularly obvious when
                the dedication is made in a deliberate, public and dynamic
                manner (Orji, 2016). For instance, humans would presumably be
                bound to help an associate's task proposition if they
                demonstrated interest when it was first mentioned to them. They
                are likewise bound to help causes in the event we state openly
                that we are behind the idea or the originator. Use of this
                principle would be an instance where a manager poses a
                progression of inquiries to an employer to affirm the
                acknowledgement of every particular segment of a framework
                before requesting acknowledgement of the entire framework. The
                employee will acknowledge the overall concession and hence will
                be obliged to commit to the task given.

                The role of personnel in a managerial position has changed from
                simply being answerable for the conveyance of work and the
                everyday administration of their colleagues to making open doors
                for organizations to develop their business (Fisher & Gonzalez,
                2013). Apparently, Human Resources (HR) divisions inside
                associations have assigned a greater amount of the everyday
                administration of individuals to administrators, as well. This
                implies that managers need to concentrate significantly more on
                the most proficient method to get the best out of their
                colleagues to meet the new requesting business challenges set by
                key partners. Persuasion skills are key to this.

                In conclusion, persuasion is convincing someone to do a
                particular thing while influence is having a dream of the ideal
                result for a circumstance or association and afterwards, without
                utilizing power or pressure, inspiring individuals to cooperate
                toward making the vision a reality. Authority and consistency
                are the two persuasive influence techniques that are explored in
                this paper. Authority can be categorized as either legal,
                expert, referent, reward or punitive. Comprehension and skilled
                utilization of persuasion are regularly the keys to
                accomplishment in a managerial position.

                Sibling rivalry is a common phenomenon, especially for kids so
                much close to each other age-wise. It gets worse for same-gender
                siblings when they reach teenage and start developing interest
                in dating as fights are often common. I will narrate my
                experience with my elder sister. I was born a year after she and
                our parents raised us in Pasadena. Our childhood days were
                always full of laughter. I remember how we would alternate
                sleeping in each other's rooms and tell stories until sleep
                carried us away. Things, however, changed when we got to high
                school.
              </p>

                It was during high school that we had new neighbors. It was a
                family of three, father, mother, and son. Their son was in
                senior year, and so was my sister then. I had grown to develop
                resentment towards my sister for her excessive concentration on
                beauty and perfection. She would spend a lot of time making up.
                Even worse, she often preferred making later appearances
                whenever we had visitors to make an impression. I was not
                jealous of her – at least not for her beauty tendencies. I felt
                like I became the default house secretary: picking calls and
                answering the doorbell, the list is endless. I would even have
                to entertain her dates while she took all her time preparing.
                Speaking of dates, she changed so regularly for reasons I never
                got to understand.
              </p>

                {" "}
                When our new next-door neighbors came to call, as usual, I was
                the one to mind the door. They were all smiles when I opened the
                door. My eyes particularly lingered on the boy; Matt was his
                name. He was tall and athletic, and his eyes seemed to twinkle
                at the corners as he widened his smile. I was surprised at my
                reaction since I rarely dated, neither did I notice boys much. I
                felt like most of them would only associate with me as a way to
                reach my sister. For a reason, I felt like Matt was going to be
                the next in my sister’s list. I ushered them in and had to keep
                them company while mom and dad made dinner. The house model was
                probably still perfecting her already perfect features.

                When she appeared, all eyes turned on her, and I could not help
                but feel a little jealous. I became invisible for the next
                couple of minutes. Our parents came too, and dinner got served.
                That swayed our attention a little as introductions got
                underway. As I had predicted, the evening ended with my sister
                and Matt making date plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Over the next couple of days, I saw much of Matt, and I came to
                like his personality. I felt pity for him knowing he would not
                last long if another bidder came calling. Eventually, it
                happened; my sister dropped him. Funny enough, he would never
                stop coming to call.
              </p>

                I always wanted to believe that I was not good enough for
                anyone, and hence I turned town every guy who asked me out. I
                felt like I was living in the shadow of my sister. Hence, when
                Matt occasionally took me out for drinks and walks, I always
                convinced myself that nothing would come out of it. However,
                when he once went out riding with my sister, I knew I had fallen
                for him. I became so disturbed and locked myself up in my room
                the whole afternoon, ignoring everyone that came knocking. It
                resulted in a lengthy talk with my parents and sister, and they
                finally made me realize that I was living in hiding. I realized
                my sister, despite being aware of my resentment for her, really
                loved me. Had I been intentionally creating walls around myself?
                As if fate was listening, the next day, Matt eventually asked me
                out! He confessed that he had long developed an interest in me,
                but I never gave him a chance.

                Indira Gandhi once stated that, “the power to question is the
                basis of all human progress.” It is undeniable that movies give
                you one of the most perfect ways to relax. However, it goes
                beyond entertainment to make alterations to the brain and the
                body in many ways, known or unknown to us. In this case, horror
                movies have often been associated with nightmares, and anxieties
                and yet for some reason still attract viewers. More than a
                quarter of all horror movie viewers experience stress reactions
                after watching. The question to ask then is: why watch horror
                movies? What do they do to your body and mind?
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Horror films contain dark themes so as to evoke fear of the
                unknown to you as you watch them. The word “horror” itself is a
                derivative of the Greek word phryke that refers to the physical
                bodily processes of shaking, shivering, shuddering, and the
                rest. Horror films therefore usually cause fear, trembling,
                closing eyes and even at times screaming. Their design and main
                objective, therefore, it to stimulate fear and other negative
                emotional responses as a means of entertainment. To achieve
                this, authors introduce evil, often in the form of supernatural
                forces, and combine light and sound to a terrifying effect.
                Movie creators have long realized that the best way to reach the
                human conscience is through the use of emotion rather than
                intelligence. Hence, watching these films interferes with the
                natural drive to control feelings. This marks the beginning of
                all psychological problems associated with horror movies.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                If you were to compare the feelings you get when watching horror
                films to those you experience from other genres, you would
                definitely find a problem. Looking at the comedy genre for
                instance, laughter characterizes them. Many researchers have
                proven that laughter has numerous benefits to health such as
                improving the body’s immunity, reducing stress hormones and
                causing dilation of blood vessels thereby improving the flow of
                blood. Horror movies, on the other hand, increase tension in the
                body affecting it physiologically. Firstly, they increase the
                heart rate due to the suspense they subject you to. This is
                especially dangerous if you have coronary heart disease because
                it can result in blood pressure among other difficulties.
                Secondly, on the psychological level, the movies may result in
                escalations of the levels of adrenaline and cortisol. In turn,
                this will spark memories of past stressful events – those you
                always forcefully repress. As a result, stress – and in worse
                case scenarios, acute stress – is inevitable and can lead to
                other psychological disorders particularly if you already have a
                pre-existing mental condition. In comparing the two genres,
                therefore, it is evident that the horror type has the potential
                to cause and increase stress. The question is how?

                Ever heard of cinematic neurosis? It is a condition
                characterized by the development of stress, somatic, demented or
                other anxiety-related responses after watching a movie. Horror
                movies top the list of the causes of cinematic neurosis.
                According to several studies on the topic, a good number of
                viewers report experiencing sleeplessness, hyperactivity, poor
                appetites and other symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms would be
                severe that they would compel those affected to attend
                psychotherapy sessions. A perfect example is what happened after
                the movie The Exorcist got released in 1973. Many individuals
                reported experiencing abnormal and severe stress, with some
                losing control over their thoughts, feelings and emotions, which
                in turn impaired their social lives and relationships. As
                aforementioned, horror films trigger past traumatic experiences
                and can escalate other pre-existing psychological conditions. It
                is therefore no surprise that majority of children exposed to
                horror movies early in life develop psychological problems in
                the future. This is because the brain registers the fears they
                experience and stores them in the amygdala. Since the amygdala
                is responsible for producing emotions, as an adult, retrieving
                those memories will always result in trauma and hence, stress.

                {" "}
                One chief component of horror movies is sound. Many researchers
                concur with the fact that it is the main cause of suspense and
                terror in horror movies. A scream piercing the still night
                atmosphere, creaking of a door, a loud sound after a long spell
                of silence (a jump-scare), hooting of an owl and a cracking
                branch in a quiet forest at night, are just a few of the sound
                devices in horror movies. These auditory devices are famous for
                producing screams and shudders during movies. They accompany
                scary visualizations such as appearances of gigantic figures,
                disappearance of people, and other things. The overall effect of
                the devices is that the memories stick to your mind for a long
                time and can cause insomnia and phobias such as fear of
                darkness. Furthermore, you will tend to respond more explosively
                to some things that you were initially less perturbed by. For
                instance, hissing of a snake in a movie can make you tremble in
                the dark whenever you hear the sound of the wind. All the above
                will likely increase your discomfort and eventually affect your
                stress levels too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not everyone will experience the same reactions to horror
                movies. According to the Emotion Theory, differences in
                personality traits make some people experience more adverse
                effects as compared to others. Furthermore, women report greater
                fear, anxiety and stress than men do. As a result, trauma and
                stressor-related disorders are more common among women than men
                after exposure to horror movies. Women have a greater disgust to
                sensitivity compared to men and hence they are more vulnerable
                to the effects of the movies. As mentioned before, age is also a
                determinant factor to your response to horror films. Exposing
                children to horror movies will therefore likely cause
                stress-related problems to them in future. From all the above,
                therefore, it is important that before you watch a movie, you
                stop to consider what you are getting yourself into. In case
                curiosity wins you over, then you can avoid as soon as you find
                yourself experiencing any negative reactions to it such as
                insomnia and anxiety. However, if it does not affect you or
                trigger any bad memories, you are immune to the effects. I
                happen to fall in this latter category myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In conclusion, it is important to note that even though horror
                movies may increase your stress level, it is mostly a short-term
                problem. The problem can be addressed once you quit watching
                them. It is rare for long-term or permanent psychological
                conditions to stem out of watching horror movies. Furthermore,
                whereas some of you may find it scary, some find it entertaining
                and satisfying. Hence, it is up to you to weigh and consider
                what it does to you before pressing the play button on the next
                one. I would not recommend the movies to anyone who has never
                had an experience with them. If you have painful memories from
                your childhood for instance of violence or witnessing a
                bloodshed, horror movies will only bring them back to the
                surface and increase your fears.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Horror movies also have a positive side to them that most
                psychologists have agreed to. They can help in desensitization
                against things you encounter daily including violence. If for
                instance you have a fear of owls, with incessant exposures to
                them in horror movies, you may ease your fear. However, if you
                develop other negative reactions as a result, it is better to
                stop. As Mathers and Bialozynski advise, stay away from them if
                they affect you negatively; but if they interest you without
                causing any influences, then you have nothing to worry about.

                and audience and hence, mostly leaves both parties satisfied.
                For effectiveness, speakers need to avoid some common speech
                patterns and habits that hinder proper communication. A few
                examples are rapid speaking, verbal fillers, uptalk, trailing
                off at the end of statements, vocal fry, and speaking in a
                monotone voice. Accents, though often unintentional, may also
                distract the audience. The audience may overlook the above
                misgivings in case when they are rare in a speech. However,
                frequent usage will definitely cause distraction.

                Verbal fillers are perhaps the most frequent of the above
                mistakes. I have had the same problem before and still
                occasionally do. This and all the above patterns can make you
                sound less confident. The secret to curbing them, however, is to
                first of all be aware of them. Recording and listening to
                yourself speak is the first step in identifying and consciously
                avoiding them. The other remedy is practicing good breathing. It
                works magic against almost every disfluency. Last is practice.
                It is best to do it with a friend and perhaps task them to punch
                you whenever you make a mistake!

                This topic has a relationship with the college’s conceptual

                The conceptual framework advocates for a learning approach that
                combines personal development with other aspects such as
                technology, culture and diversity, and creativity among other
                elements. This topic also requires all the above to master the

            <Accordion.Header>A Lesson Plan</Accordion.Header>

              <p>
                {" "}
                A lesson plan is a daily guide to how and what a teacher will
                teach students, the teaching resources and the means of
                measuring the lesson. It adds to the effectiveness of a lesson
                and ensures all the learner’s needs get captured. Lesson plans
                vary depending on the topic and the needs of the learners.
                However, there are basic components that should be available in
                every lesson plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Firstly, a good lesson plan must have objectives. The objectives
                refer to the specific goals or aims a teacher has for the
                students by the end of a lesson. Objectives must be logical and
                achievable. A good objective should describe a measureable
                behavior. Most importantly, it should be something a learner
                will be able to demonstrate and not just comprehend.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The second key component is sequencing: the order in which
                teaching and learning activities. For most lesson plans, set
                induction comes first and in entails catching the learners’
                attention. The sequencing should back the objectives and have
                proper transitions between one activity and another.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Thirdly, a good lesson plan should have timing. Timing will
                ensure that all the objectives get attained by the end of the
                lesson. Furthermore, activities that demand more attention can
                get a bigger time allocation.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Assessment is the fourth basic component of a lesson plan. It
                outlines how the teacher will evaluate the students’ grasp on
                the topic. Assessment makes a teacher know whether or not all
                the lesson objectives got achieved.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Finally, a good lesson plan should include materials or
                resources. Materials comprise books, pens, charts, audio-visual
                tools and diagrams. Including materials in a lesson plan ensures
                the teacher makes adequate preparations to collect all the
                requirements in advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                When making a lesson plan for exceptional learners, it is often
                necessary to scaffold the details. Exceptional learners mostly
                do not have the same skills and competencies their same-aged
                peers have. Hence, by scaffolding, a teacher helps them to work
                with information that is appropriate to their age and
                capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The institution from the conceptual framework aims to be an
                advocate for learning to promote professionalism. Competency in
                lesson plans is part of the professional disposition of an
                educator. Hence, the topic relates to the college conceptual
                framework in that both advocate for creating a conducive and
                considerate environment for all learners.{" "}

                Assessments provide educators with a rationale to gauge the
                level of understanding of learners so as to plan effectively
                whatever improvements may be necessary. Assessments can be
                formal and informal and can measure different aspects of a
                learner’s abilities and talents.

                Most educators treat assessments as entirely a means of feedback
                for preset goals and objectives. However, in my view assessments
                have a far greater purpose than the generally perceived one.
                Assessments are also a means of motivation and reinforcement for
                the learners. In every classroom there will always be
                competition and assessments provide the best battleground. Low
                performers will always feel motivated to identify their areas of
                weakness while the high performers would seek to improve to
                avoid getting caught up with. For learners whose self-esteem
                gets hurt by failure, educators find the perfect opportunity to
                chip in.

                In the special education classroom, assessments – formative and
                summative – still play a key role both to the teacher and
                learner. Formative assessments identify shortcomings during a
                lesson. Summative assessments, on the other hand, evaluate
                learners’ competence at the end of a learning period. A good
                formative assessment for special education classrooms is a
                homework quiz. For summative tests, the most appropriate is
                teacher-constructed since it will be within a derivative of
                teacher’s daily interactions with learners. Formative
                assessments are most efficient since they are come in short time
                intervals.

              How Social Media Supports Contemporary Personal Relationships
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Social media only recently came into the picture, precisely in
                the first decade of the 21st century. The rate of its
                advancement has been alarming and it has continued to bring new
                ways of social interaction and personal relationships. Its
                impact has especially been evident among the youth as they
                continue to dominate most of the social media sites as compared
                to adults. The reason for the observation is quite obvious –
                they are ‘digital natives’ (Chambers, 2013). Many scholars
                justify the above statement on the grounds that teens got born
                into the digital age, hence the term ‘digital natives’ (Thorne,
                2009; Palfrey and Gasser, 2008). Older people, on the other
                hand, have had to familiarize themselves with technological
                tools adults. Chambers (2013) refers to them as ‘digital
                immigrants’ since their link to the digital age is not natural.
                Nevertheless, they also use the social media but not to the same
                magnitude teens do. Furthermore, adults mainly use the social
                media for professional purposes whereas for the young
                generation, it is for personal motives. The increasing
                interaction with the social media is proving to be beneficial
                towards the augmentation of personal relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Social media platforms have given people of all ages an
                opportunity to interact with more people from all over the world
                with whom they share similar interests. The move by some of
                them, an example being Facebook, to extend membership to even
                younger people, has increased the number of users considerably.
                Currently, anyone aged 13 and above can use Facebook without any
                restriction (Chambers, 2013). The rapidly increasing numbers
                have metamorphosed the nature of social interactions. Personal
                relationships are getting more complicated with the new modes of
                communication and etiquette resulting from the minimal physical
                contact. Most observations indicate that social media
                strengthens the existing personal relationships while also
                increasing one’s friends circle (Chambers, 2013). This article
                will discuss, mostly focusing the youth as illustration, how
                social networks have and are continuing to change influence
                personal relationships.
              </p>
              <h2>Nature of the relationship</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Social media complemented mobile phone calls and instant
                messaging that preceded it. Phone calls and instant messaging
                limited communication to only people within one’s circle. The
                question that researchers asked themselves, therefore, with the
                advent of the internet was whether it would widen the scope of
                social interaction or simply enhance the existing personal ties
                (Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe, 2007; Ellison, Lampe and
                Steinfield, 2010). The hypothesis was that it would result in
                more interactions with new people from other regions of the
                world, leading to relationships that would begin online before
                moving offline. However, the results were not quite as they had
                been predicted. Social network sites did not result in
                initiation of new relationships but instead served as enhancers
                of existing offline relationships (Chambers, 2013). They
                provided what instant messaging and phone calls were providing
                but in advanced ways. For instance, sharing of media became
                possible with social media. Hence, the existing relationships
                got boosted and while there were also new friends made, the
                bonds did not become as strong. In Facebook, for instance, it
                was common to find people having numerous friends but keeping
                touch with an average of five close friends most of them from
                their offline circle (Binder, Howes and Sutcliffe, 2009;
                Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe, 2007; Choi, 2006; Wilson et al.,
                2009). There is sufficient evidence proving that social media
                mainly came in to improve existing ties rather than form new
                ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                A study by Lampe, Ellison and Steinfield (2007) on undergraduate
                college students deduced that they used social network sites to
                find offline connections. The study was via a survey completed
                by over 1000 students and majorly used Facebook as an example
                being a common site among the youth. Facebook by design gives
                the users a chance to make meaningful personal relationships by
                allowing them to identify things they have in common with other
                users. The research, therefore, indicated that most users would
                rely on the information on other users’ profiles to find
                something they might have in common offline. For instance,
                people would prefer to interact with those from their schooling
                environments, same towns, or same working environment, all of
                which are easily accessible through the profiles of other users.
                Furthermore, the system gives suggestions about people one may
                know or prefer to interact with from a particular location or
                environment. As little a factor as finding someone from one’s
                hometown forms a reference point for most youths to begin
                interacting and possibly establish contact in future (Lampe,
                Ellison and Steinfield, 2007).
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                A similar study by Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe, (2007) came up
                with an almost similar outcome. The survey of 286 undergraduate
                students in the United States showed that users of social media
                platforms had a tendency to connect with other users with whom
                they had common offline connections (Ellison, Steinfield and
                Lampe, 2007). These connections could be existing friendships,
                being former or current classmates, neighbors or workmates.
                Furthermore, according to Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe, (2007),
                most Facebook searches involve users one has some offline
                connection with and rarely do people search for total strangers.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                From the foregoing, it is evident that social network sites,
                contrary to the expectations at their inception, rarely initiate
                personal relationships. Despite their potential to connect
                people globally, they do not seem to appeal to people when it
                comes to starting new relationships (Boneva et al., 2006).
                However, the brighter side of it is that they have enhanced
                existing personal relationships to levels not realized before.
                Furthermore, social media has not replaced the traditional
                face-to-face communication and interaction as most people had
                thought it would. According to Livingstone (2009), it has
                instead complemented the old ways by embedding itself into
                personal lives of the youth and other people. Hence, social
                media has not changed the nature of personal relationships but
                rather has heightened it.
              </p>
              <h2>Social Media and Intimacy</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Social media has become embedded into the personal lives of the
                youth to the extent of making them fail to notice other
                pre-existent forms of communication. Emailing is one mode that
                has lost popularity among the youth – almost entirely (Chambers,
                2013). A significant majority of the youth currently rarely ever
                interact with mails; some do not even know how it works
                (Gershon, 2010). To others, it is a form of communication only
                suitable for formal occasions such as job applications and
                letter writing. However, with social media, most young people
                feel the freedom to have romantic associations without the
                traditional and institutional barriers. The technology allows
                the youth to engage in continuous and consistent chats that
                eradicate the fear of being in under the watch of parents or
                society. Ito and Okabe (2005) described this as ‘tele-cocooning
                in the full-time intimate community.’ It gives them a feeling of
                belonging and identity.

                {" "}
                Besides the freedom it gives the youth to interact, social media
                also ensures that young people remain in contact where physical
                contact is impossible to establish. The youth converge in
                network sites the same way people would go to parks or to
                shopping malls (Chambers, 2013). There are numerous tools at
                their disposal that comfortably fill in for the lack of physical
                contact, hence making them express themselves fairly
                effectively. Friendship and romance gets cultivated through the
                sharing of images, videos, quotes, jokes and creations that only
                carry meaning to the intended audience. Hence, to a great
                extent, social media has revolutionized personal relationships,
                especially where intimacy is concerned. The interactions are
                without surveillance and hence, there is freedom to express the
                deepest of feelings without fear or shyness. The motivation
                behind the social network interactions is friendship but with a
                prominence on involvement or ‘hanging out’ as Ito et al. (2010)
                choose to call it.

              <h2>The Impact of Weak Online Ties</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                One common characteristic of most social media platforms is the
                allowance to have very many friends. Having many friends on a
                platform like Facebook is often just for prestige and most young
                people hardly know a quarter of the people in their friend
                lists. Naturally, no one can manage to maintain contact with a
                huge number of friends and only keep them so as to access more
                news feeds and other trending information. As a result, most
                friendships on the social media are rather weak, hence
                questioning how beneficial they are to personal relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                According to Caroline Haythornthwhite (2005), the best word to
                describe the weak friendships is ‘latent ties.’ Latent ties
                refer to the way in which technological tools of social media
                have brought people together where it would naturally never have
                happened (Chambers, 2013). Haythornthwhite (2005) defines latent
                ties as associations theoretically probable but yet to be
                socially activated. New modes of communication always bring with
                them unique and specific latent ties. Latent ties play a key
                role in the enhancement of personal relationships; specifically,
                they create new relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Weak ties have an advantage over strong ones in that they offer
                a variety of resources and opportunities that strong ties such
                as those of family and close friends cannot offer. As earlier
                mentioned, having many friends, even without having constant
                contact with them, gives one access to more news feeds and
                information. Hence, individuals with widespread latent ties have
                access to new ideas, job opportunities and other information.
                Some people may be part of a social group in a social network
                site just because they have a friend in the group but not
                necessarily knowing anyone in the group. Their membership allows
                them to access all the opportunities posted there. Furthermore,
                they can share the same information to other places and as a
                result, may people benefit from the weak ties. Putnam (2000)
                calls these benefits resulting from weak ties ‘bridging
                capital.’ With time, these benefits turn into personal
                relationships when people begin making inquiries and seeking for
                assistance to access a particular opportunity. In some cases, an
                opportunity may fall on a group as a whole leading to workplace
                relations.
              </p>
              <h2>Freedom of Choice</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                One thing that has often affected personal relationships is
                societal perceptions. Even where one is doing the right thing,
                there will always be a confrontation between societal perception
                and personal intuition. Hence, with choosing who to relate with,
                society will always find a way to judge someone’s choice. Most
                failed relationships result from societal pressures that lead to
                disagreements. However, with the social media, the lack of
                physical contact shields relationships from society’s scrutiny.
                Personal relationships can, therefore, grow strong without much
                opposition and by the time the connections get offline, there is
                steadiness that cannot get easily shaken by societal pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though most social media associations come after prior
                offline connection, there are relationships that begin online
                before getting offline. There are numerous dating sites that
                make it easier for people to meet and associate, forming strong
                personal relationships. A survey done in 2017 indicated that up
                to 39% of heterosexual partners met online through the social
                media (Moore, 2020). This percentage is an increase from the
                last one done in 2009 that stood at 22% (Moore, 2020). The
                improvement shows the growing levels of trust people are having
                in the social media. Of course, there are associated risks of
                meeting strangers online and beginning a relationship with them
                but with proper judgement, something positive may come out of
                it. Currently, there are many dating sites, some of them
                tailor-made for specific groups, for instance, Christian dating
                sites. The issue of grouping has managed to bring confidence to
                classes judged harshly by society such as the LGBTQ (Lesbian,
                Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer) community – otherwise
                popularly referred to as the gay community though not
                all-encompassing.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Even though countries are coming to accept the LGBTQ community
                and even granting it rights in their constitutions, society is
                still not fully receptive. Hence, coming out and admitting to
                being a member is always a difficult task and subjects one to
                critical judgment and sometimes isolation from other society
                members in most regions. The Tinder survey conducted recently
                has indicated that social media has played a key role in
                strengthening relationships within this community. More than 80%
                of the participants of the survey admitted that social media
                platforms, and particularly online dating sites, have been
                instrumental in the growth of their community (Moore, 2020). The
                social media has helped them gain the confidence to stand out as
                a result of the interactions they have had with their colleagues
                online from many regions. More importantly, it has helped to
                cultivate personal relationships freely without bending to
                societal pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Finally, social media has contributed to keeping couples
                together. Social media besides bringing people together, helps
                maintain people together in a variety of ways. Firstly, through
                the sharing of media items and the ease of communication
                regardless of the distance, couples can feel the presence of
                their partners from wherever they are (Moore, 2020). Social
                media platforms have great tools such as video chats that ensure
                communication feels natural. Secondly, many platforms offer
                professional guidance to couples on how to keep their
                relationship working. Many couples have successfully improved
                their relationships through the sites, but even then, care
                should be taken to avoid making comparisons with other couples
                online.
              </p>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                {" "}
                From all the above-mentioned information, it is evident that
                social media plays a great role in improving personal
                relationships across all ages. Firstly, it helps to maintain and
                improve personal relationships that exist offline. While instant
                messaging and mobile phone calls have served people well, social
                media platforms have provided an extra element of intimacy.
                Through the sharing of images and other media items, people in
                long-distant relationships feel the gap reduce. While social
                media was expected to replace the old forms of communication, it
                has instead helped complemented them and hence, enhanced
                personal relationships. Secondly, through establishment of weak
                ties as a result of having to interact with many people, strong
                ties result from the sharing of beneficial information. Hence,
                again the benefit is on personal relationships. Finally, social
                media has also continued to result in formation of new
                relationships. Thorough online dating applications, people meet
                and establish offline relationships with time away from
                society’s judgmental eye. Furthermore, groups not very
                acceptable in society have a chance to develop their personal
                relationships online where there is no isolation and prejudice.
              </p>
              <p>
                An overarching advantage social media comes with is the
                preservation of memories. Social media, unlike physical contact,
                does not rely on human memory for storage of information. All
                the information shared via social media platforms can get backed
                up for future retrieval and reminiscing. The beauty of personal
                communication is having memories to remind people of the far
                they have come in the relationship and to give them hope through
                difficult times. Furthermore, social media, unlike the photo
                albums, have an added feature, that is, followers. People can
                share their personal relationship experiences online and allow
                the online community to react, either liking, by making comments
                or both. Having the public support is one thing that keeps
                couples going and proud of their achievements. Therefore, will
                all the above literature and discussion, it is undisputable that
                social media is paramount towards the development of personal
                relationships.
