              <h1>Introduction </h1>
              <p>
                Neil Bohr was a Physicist from Denmark. In 1913 Neil Bohr
                postulated the atom model currently termed as Bohr atomic model,
                which was named after him. The Bohr model is an advancement to
                the earlier atomic models; Rutherford model (1911), Saturnian
                model (1904), cubic model (1902) and plum-pudding model (1904).
                The model proposed by Neil Bohr, modified the model of
                Rutherford more than the other model. An overview of Rutherford
                model of atom is paramount in understanding the Bohr atomic
                model. Despite Neil Bohr’s model being a modification of earlier
                works of atom it has some limitations (Stachel, 2009).{" "}

                According to electromagnetic theory and classical mechanics, a
                radiation is emitted by a particle that is charged and moving in
                a path that is curved. Owing to this property Rutherford model
                was deemed to be unstable, as energy will be lose by the
                electrons and spiral into the nucleus. The Bohr model aimed at
                overcoming the shortcoming that arise in Rutherford model. The
                modification postulated by Bohr is that electrons move in paths
                known as orbits. The characteristic of the orbit is that it has
                a fixed energy and size (Bohr, 1913). The possibility of
                radiation in the model is only when an electron moves from one
                orbit to another when excited. In the lowest state of the orbit
                the atom will be completely stable. The behavior is attributed
                to the fact that the electron has no orbit of lower energy in
                which it can enter.

                The Bohr model postulates that an orbit consists of a positively
                charged nucleus that is surrounded by electrons. The electrons
                are constantly rotating round the nucleus. The electrons are
                cable of moving from one energy level to another in specified
                conditions (Bohr, 1921). The model is illustrated in figure 1

                atom in comprehension of the nature of an atom. It also looks at

                In the 20th century Earnest Rutherford came up with a model to
                explain the structure of an atom. Rutherford works explains that
                atom consists of a positive nucleus surrounded by dense
                electrons. The Rutherford atomic model followed Larmor formula.
                The formula predicted that the rotating electrons will release
                electromagnetic radiations as it rotates round the nucleus.
                (Classical mechanics). The Rutherford model suggested that all
                atoms are unstable. According to the model the motion of the
                electrons is in a spiral form and in a given time approximately
                16 picoseconds it collapses to the nucleus. The stream of
                electromagnetic radiation also increases as the electrons
                collapsed to the nucleus. This is because as the spiral motion
                progresses the atomic size reduces increasing the frequency.
                Later in the 19th century it was discovered that atoms emits
                energy at discrete frequencies (Stachel, 2009).

                To overcome the shortcoming of the Rutherford model of atom Neil
                Bohr came up with the Bohr atomic model in the year 1913. The
                model has three postulates that describes it (Bohr, 1913):
                Contrary to classical theory Bohr atomic model postulated that
                electrons rotate round the nucleus without any radiations. The
                orbits that the electrons are found are stable and are termed as
                stationery orbits. There is a zero probability of another atom
                located in between the discrete orbits. The angular speed of a
                rotating electron where the stationery orbit can be located is a
                numerical multiple of the reduced Planck constant. m_e vr=nℏ The
                value of n takes an integer value which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
                6…………… The number n is termed as the principal quantum number.
                The value of ℏ is calculates as ℏ=h/2π The least possible value
                of n is one. The Bohr radius which is the smallest radius of an
                atom obtained using the value of n (n =1) is 0.0529 nm. Once an
                electron is in the Bohr radius there is no other closer orbit
                that is more close to the nucleus. This postulation enables Bohr
                to calculate the hydrogen’s energy of the allowed orbits. The
                calculations of the allowed energies cut across atoms of other
                elements as well. In Bohr model the movement of the electrons
                around the nucleus does not result in electromagnetic radiation.
                Neil Bohr postulated the model basing it on Planck’s theory of
                radiation. The means that an electron can lose or gain energy is
                by moving from one allowed energy level to another, emitting or
                absorbing electromagnetic radiation. The frequency at which the
                radiation occurs can be determined by the difference of the
                energy level. The formula that is used is derived from the
                planks relation; ΔE=E_2-E_1=hv h is the planks constant.

                {" "}
                Comparing to Bohr and Einstein’s theory of photoelectric effect,
                Bohr’s model takes into assumption that as an electron moving
                from one energy level to another an energy amount that is
                discrete is radiated. However, Bohr did not deviate from the
                classical Maxwell theory as opposed to Einstein. The
                discreteness of the energy level of the atom allowed the
                quantization of the electromagnetic field. While Maxwell
                believed in the existence of photons, Bohr did not believe in it
                (Bohr, 1921).

                The rotation of frequency of an atom with a numerical multiple
                of that particular frequency having harmonics is equal to
                frequency of frequency of classical radiation. This is according
                to Maxwell. The result are obtained from the model of Bohr of
                atoms moving from one energy level to another. For an orbit n
                the frequency of k-th harmonic is produced by the movements of
                the electrons from one energy level to another. For Rydberg
                states (these are for very large values of n), two atoms that
                are involved in the change of electron energy have approximately
                the same frequency of rotation. In such a scenario the classical
                theory is not ambiguous. The classical theory has no unambiguous
                interpretation from very small value of n (and k). This leads to
                correspondence principle which states that the classical theory
                and quantum theory should agree in cases of quantum numbers that
                are very large.

                Bohr defined that the Planck constant is an integer multiple of
                angular momentum. De Broglie in the year 1924 defined the case
                as a standing wave condition; the wavelength that fits in the
                electron’s orbit and the wave are the parameters that describes
                the electron. nλ=2πT Electron behaves like waves as de Broglie’s
                asserted. In this manner de Broglie’s wavelength of an electron
                is: λ=h/mv De Broglie wavelength of an electron asserts that
                nh/mv=2πT Or nh/2π=mvr The angular momentum of the electron
                moving round on the nucleus ismvr.

                De Broglie described the wavelength of an electron asλ=h/p. ,
                while the angular momentum of an electron as described by Neil
                Bohr is1/2h. Bohr later rectified his work and appealed to the
                correspondence principles. The rectification however did not
                provide any explanation on wave interpretation.

                The Bohr atomic model of electron orbiting around the nucleus
                was extrapolated accurately by quantum mechanics. The theory was
                put in place by Werner Heisenberg. An Australian Physicist Erwin
                Schrödinger also discovered the same theory. The theory by
                Schrödinger was independent of the work of Werner Heisenberg.
                The theory explored electrons that are fixed to rotate around
                the nucleus of atom of a hydrogen. The theory employed the
                solution of three dimensional wave equation. The Bohr atomic
                model played a core role in developing the quantum mechanics.

                Neil Bohr postulate the Bohr atomic model. The atomic model is
                an advancement to the earlier atomic models; Rutherford model
                (1911), Saturnian model (1904), cubic model (1902) and
                plum-pudding model (1904). The Bohr model postulates that an
                orbit consists of a positively charged nucleus that is
                surrounded by electrons. The electrons are constantly rotating
                round the nucleus and are capable of moving from one energy
                level to another under specified conditions. The Bohr atomic
                model postulated that electrons rotate round the nucleus without
                radiating radiations, angular speed of a rotating electron where
                the stationery orbit can be located is a numerical multiple of
                the reduced Planck constant and an electron can lose or gain
                energy is by moving from one allowed energy level to another,
                emitting or absorbing electromagnetic radiation. The Bohr atomic
                model played a great role in development of other theories.
                Quantum mechanics developed by Werner Heisenberg and Physicist
                Erwin Schrödinger used the concepts of Bohr atomic model.
