                The article 'What 'Snowflakes' Get Right About free speech' Baer
                discusses freedom of speech concerning students. The author
                advises resisting rehashing the debate of personal experience
                over reason and argument in expressing oneself. This is because
                of a change in the generation. By basing the argument on the
                philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard, Baer asserts that certain
                topics limit speech as a public good. Citing a demonstration in
                the Auburn against spencer's visit, the author portrays no need
                to discuss views that invalidate humanity. The students
                demonstrate against unregulated speech, protection against
                visiting speakers, and curricula that they believe disrespects
                them. This essay explores the key elements in the argument,
                their relation, and their analysis.

                Baer portrays that there is a limitation to freedom of speech.
                This happens as a public good. Citing the demonstration at
                Auburn against Spencer's visit, the author claims that the
                protest was against the speaker’s speech. When a view
                invalidates the humanity of some people, it can be restricted
                for the public good. Freedom of speech does not permit one to
                state anything that they think. It implies adjusting the inborn
                estimation of a given view with the commitment to guarantee that
                different individuals from a given community will be entirely at
                ease with the speech.

                Free speech has been misunderstood. It has been outlined
                inaccurately as contention between free discourse and annoyed
                sentiments of pampered, oversensitive students. The issue is
                that free speech possibly has importance in the college when
                it's combined with the legitimately commanded standard of
                balance for every single qualified member: equity of
                participation and opportunity. So, when a speaker recommends
                that a few people are intrinsically sub-par, such discourse
                clashes straightforwardly with the college's order to give
                equivalent access to its offices and assets. Free speech,
                besides, is neither a sweeping authorization to state anything
                without result nor indistinguishable with scholarly opportunity.

              <p>
                {" "}
                Baer asserts that the urge to block speech is not related to
                political correctness but is actually a reminder that the
                college's motivation is to vet thoughts and control speech so
                that educating and learning can continue, is identified with the
                current generation’s acknowledgment that free speech has become
                a weapon for conservatives to subvert fairness and the college
                itself. It mirrors another age's mindfulness that free speech
                can cause an inciteful action rather than setting people free.

                {" "}
                There is a logical flow in the argument presented by Baer. Using
                a statement posted by a filmmaker 'madame, you are an experience
                but not an argument,' the article's whole content revolves
                around it. Though the debate between argument and experience is
                cut short, the article is solely based on argument. Baer, who is
                a professor, does not explain the article basing on experience.
                Rather, the article is based on an argument with appropriate
                references.

                Freedom of speech is a complex human right to understand. The
                meaning of the word freedom is the power to act, think, to speak
                as one wants. From Baer's point of view, there are limitations
                to the topics which one can talk about. This distorts the
                meaning of the original implication of the word. To rectify this
                niche, perhaps a clear definition of freedom of speech is
                necessary to avoid misinterpretations.

                The United States Electoral College has been under heavy
                criticism for a long time now despite proving to be an effective
                means of electing a president for decades. For proper
                understanding, it refers to a group of individuals formed every
                four years for the purpose of electing the president. Each state
                has a specific number that rhymes with their numbers in the
                House of Representatives. In this system, winning the popular
                vote does not count for anything since the Electoral College
                determines the winner. It has, therefore, been a subject of
                deliberation for over a decade now, with some of its critics
                arguing that it ignores the people's preference, hence wanting
                its abolition. The Electoral College is an outdated and biased
                system, and this discussion will explain why it should get
                abandoned.

                Firstly, the Electoral College got founded for the wrong
                reasons, and nothing got done to fix it. The founders doubted
                the ability and intelligence of the American people to make a
                wise choice for president. Initially, voting was always a
                privilege for a few people: white elites who were above the age
                of 21 and owned land. When the 14th amendment of the
                constitution granted every individual the right to vote, the
                Electoral College also came into the picture to ensure the right
                choices got made. Therefore, sticking with the system to date
                means that there is still a belief that not everyone in the
                nation is “smart” enough to vote.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Secondly, the system is not a true reflection of democracy.
                Failure of voters in a state to turn up for voting does not have
                an impact on the final results since the Electoral College
                carries the state’s votes. Therefore, the choice is not really
                the people’s, raising questions on the whole concept of
                democracy. It is no wonder, therefore, that very few people turn
                up for voting. In 2016 only about 57% of the total eligible
                voters turned up.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Despite the criticism, there are good reasons to maintain the
                system. Regardless of the population of a state, each gets a
                minimum of three electoral votes. Abolishing the system,
                therefore, would mean that the geographically and
                demographically smaller states would have their power
                significantly reduced. No candidate would want to waste his
                time, for instance, going to a state like Wyoming since its
                votes would hardly make a difference. Instead, they would
                concentrate their efforts in bigger states such as Texas that
                would have a bigger say in the elections. Therefore, in a way,
                the Electoral College has checked the powers of the states.

                {" "}
                It is, however, no secret that the cons outweigh the pros of the
                Electoral College. In every election period, one of the hottest
                topics of discussion is “swing states.” These refer to the
                states that either of the two main parties can reasonably win.
                Swing states are often the determiners of the outcome of the
                presidency. As a result, most of the attention and heavy
                campaigns fall in these states. Furthermore, swing states get
                more favors, such as federal waivers and presidentially
                regulated expenditures. In the process, the so-called "safe
                states" that shelter over 70% of the American population remains
                ignored. It, therefore, points to the fact that only a few
                states make a difference in the presidential election using this
                system. What is the need then for someone from a safe state to
                vote, knowing well the fate of their state?

                In conclusion, from the above-mentioned information, it is
                evident that the Electoral College needs revisiting. The United
                States constitution has seen several amendments before, and it
                would not hurt to do one or a couple more. Looking at the
                previous elections, four ended with a winner of the popular vote
                failing to become president courtesy of the Electoral College.
                The most recent was in 2016 when Hillary Clinton beat Donald
                Trump by a margin of almost 3 million votes. However, the
                electoral votes went in favor of the latter, and hence, she
                missed out on the Whitehouse. Clearly, the people exercised
                their right to vote and chose their preferred leader, but the
                system failed to grant their wish. Democracy came into the
                picture to give people the freedom to choose their leaders. The
                Electoral College, however, seems to stand in the way of
                democracy, and it is becoming even more difficult to convince
                people to vote. Hence, if the United States wishes to maintain
                the trust of the people, it is high time the Electoral College
                got replaced.{" "}
