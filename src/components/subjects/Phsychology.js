                Researchers from Pontifical University explored the probability
                of predicting human behavior through the analysis of their
                social media activity. They developed their research from the
                works of Luini et al. (2015), who analyzed data from social
                media to find out cognitive factors behind criminal behavior.
                They found new information reinforcing the works of Luini et al.
                The main objective of the study by Luini et al. was to
                demonstrate the usefulness of social maps and Web applications
                in investigative analysis and spatial cognition research. The
                hypothesis for the study was that user areas of activity are
                predictable (Luini et al., 2015).

                The research considered the variables social media activity
                against human mobility and social interaction. The researchers
                wanted to find out how mobility influences traveling behaviors
                and social thinking. They applied a correlational research
                design to compare the two variables against each other. The
                study presented 100 twitter accounts that had more than two
                hundred and fifty tweets to geographical techniques to test the
                hypothesis (Luini et al., 2015). It yielded positive results,
                managing to establish their movements, residences, and traveling
                behaviors to a high percentage of precision. The results of the
                study are important in establishing social interactions and also
                in curbing criminal tendencies (Luini et al., 2015). The
                research met ethical standards because participation was
                voluntary. The participants were aware of the study and
                consented after getting all the details of the research at an
                earlier period. Furthermore, even though the information is in
                the public domain, their identities remain concealed.

                Earlier researchers have also conducted studies on the same
                topic using different methods. Spence & Feng (2010) did
                correlational research on how video games can modify spatial
                cognition processes. Their findings indicated that overexposure
                to video games could cause alterations in an individual's brain
                and behavior.

                Stephens, in his article, discusses the revolutions in various
                media forms. He acknowledges the significant steps that the
                world has taken in developing the field. There are new
                communication means that have done away with geographical and
                financial boundaries (Stephens, 2011). However, he hypothesizes
                that the new modes of communication will have greater
                revolutionary effects: besides making it easier to access
                information. According to Stephens, the revolutions in
                communication will also change our entire way of thinking. In
                its radical manifestation, it could result in a different light
                in social thinking (Stephens, 2011). The variables in the study
                are communications revolution versus social thinking. The
                research design applied is historical research.

                Stephens explores how the communication system has raised
                grumbles and complaints. According to Plato, complaints mostly
                emanated from the old men who still had deep attachments to the
                past. He quotes several ancient people's takes on the new
                technology. Basing on the Bible, people seeking closeness with
                God go to the "wilderness," which, according to the article, is
                an attack on modernity. Moreover, the second commandment in
                Exodus is a stern warning and prohibition against technological
                advancements: “You shall not make for yourself a sculptured
                image, or any likeness of what is in the heavens above, or on
                the earth below or in the waters under the earth" (Tanakh,
                1985). Stephens quotes more people in history who came out to
                strongly oppose communication revolutions, including Pope. He
                particularly attacked the print terming it "a scourge for the
                sins of the learned." The research got conducted ethically based
                on its objectivity and direct quotes that point towards the
                credibility of the work.

                Zerback et al. (2015) explored in their research how the media
                influences the climate of opinion through explicit and implicit
                cues. They titled their work "Thinking of Others." Explicit cues
                refer to the public distribution of opinions, while implicit
                cues are arguments without any reference (Zerback et al., 2015).
                Explicit cues show the prevailing opinions in society. For
                instance, the media can release survey results highlighting the
                popularity of a presidential candidate. Implicit cues, on the
                other hand, do not give a direct reference to the climate of
                opinions and hence leave recipients to create the link (Zernack
                et al., 2015). For instance, a group of people may organize
                protests against government policy. In such a scenario,
                recipients can only generalize the move. The hypotheses for the
                research were:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Surveys, as explicit media cues, influence recipients’
                    judgments of the climate of opinion in the direction of the
                    survey results, and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If arguments in a media report support (oppose) a certain
                    opinion, the perceived public agreement to this opinion
                    increases (decreases) (Zerback et al., 2015).

                {" "}
                The research showed that explicit and implicit cues affected
                people’s decision making in several ways. For instance, explicit
                cues can cause people to change their standing and support a
                winning side. Sometimes they may cause the underdog effect where
                people will tend to support a losing side out of pity (Zerback
                et al., 2015).

                Zerback et al. applied a true experimental research design in
                the study. The purpose of this design is to establish the actual
                cause-and-effect relationships. In the experiment, a newspaper
                ran a fictional advert on the expansion of a suburb express
                railway in Cologne, Germany. The research required the
                participants to answer some questions after reading the article.
                The researchers chose the topic because it allowed them to
                modify the details to suit their needs. Some of the respondents
                were given survey data, while others were not. The results
                indicated that people conformed their responses to survey
                results (Zerback et al., 2015).

                Even though the research was effective, it lacked honesty in how
                it streamlined the questions. Hence, it failed to reach some
                ethical standards. Hasinoff also discusses the impact the media
                has had on social thinking. Her journal “Sexting as a media
                production: Rethinking social media and sexuality,” she handles
                society’s view on sexting and argues for or against it. She
                hypothesizes that the digital media influences girls’
                communication: how and with whom they communicate. Her work is a
                literature review and focuses specifically on girls.

                Society has often blamed mobile phones for causing unacceptable
                behaviors among girls. Sexting is one area that has always been
                in the spotlight. It exposes girls to early sexual activities,
                makes them vulnerable to possible online predators, and even
                causes unwanted pregnancies (Hasinoff, 2012). Often the cause
                for the dangers is the occasional "leakage" of explicit images
                online, causing predators to surface and put the girls' lives in
                danger (Hasinoff, 2012). Hasinoff, however, gives an alternative
                way of viewing sexting and the media that could have productive
                results.

                {" "}
                According to the review, even though sexting has dangers, the
                geographical separation and anonymity provide some security to
                the parties. It also gives them a chance to socialize,
                especially if they have to cope with stigma at school and home
                environments (Hasinoff, 2012). This particularly covers minority
                groups such as lesbians. Furthermore, it improves communication
                by giving the girls a feeling of bravery that is usually absent
                during physical communication (Hasinoff, 2012). Hence, girls can
                easily communicate their sexual needs to their partners. To wrap
                it all up, it improves communication skills since the media
                merges different cultures, ethnicities, and ages. The
                objectivity of Hasinoff’s review makes her presentation of ideas
                ethical.

                Finally, Wright & Silberman (2018) analyze how the media
                influences some driving behaviors among adolescents and adults.
                The title of their journal is "Media influences on perception of
                driving risk and behaviors of adolescents and emerging adults."
                Continued exposure to movies and games featuring risky driving
                has an impact on both adolescents and adults (Wright &
                Silberman, 2018). They come up with the following hypotheses:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    {" "}
                    Incessant exposure to dangerous driving tendencies over the
                    media causes positive attitudes towards the same behaviors
                    and increases the likelihood of engaging in them.

                    {" "}
                    Media exposure relates to the attitudes of the concerned
                    party, which in turn is related to their driving behaviors
                    (Wright & Silberman, 2018).

                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                The study employed a true-experimental research design where the
                variables were media exposure to dangerous driving versus
                driving behaviors. The experiment observed 1356 male and female
                college students aged between 17 and 35 years old (Wright &
                Silberman, 2018).

                The results confirmed the hypotheses as they established that
                media exposure to dangerous driving results in risky driving
                behaviors (Wright & Silberman, 2018). Furthermore, sex and age
                were some of the determining factors to the extent of behavior
                exhibited. The study found that movies play a greater role in
                impacting driving attitudes compared to video games (Wright &
                Silberman, 2018). In general, the research established that
                media content and negative driving outcomes had an interceded
                relationship (Wright & Silberman, 2018).

                Psychological research employs a number of concepts and methods.
                Different types of research require the application of different
                methods and concepts. They all play a crucial role in the
                outcome of the study. Some of the significant psychological
                research concepts include hypotheses, sampling, variables, case
                studies, and peer review. The hypothesis of research refers to a
                prediction that is subject to approval or disapproval after an
                investigation, such as an experiment. The hypothetico-deductive
                theory applies testing of hypotheses against experiments to
                investigate something (Haig, 2018). Hypotheses are always
                subject to support or refute. Those that stand against all
                criticisms are said to be corroborated. Sampling involves
                selecting a target population for research. It is important in
                that it makes work easier with application generalizations on
                the sample to represent the entire population. Case studies are
                detailed investigations of an individual, group, or phenomenon.
                They are very common in psychological research. They are vital
                for their resourcefulness and high degrees of accuracy and
                ecological credibility. Finally, peer review refers to the
                voluntary assessment by an expert in the field of an article
                written by a researcher. It is essential since it ensures
                originality and prevents inaccurate figures from getting to the
                public. There are many other concepts, such as meta-analysis,
                content analysis, plot study, and correlation. The choice of
                which ones to use depends on the type of research one conducts.

                It is possible to predict human behavior using the above
                psychological concepts. For example, one can form the
                hypothesis; a proper diet boosts students' performance in
                school. The hypothetico-deductive method would then come in
                handy to test the credibility of the hypothesis. There are two
                ways of testing hypotheses using the theory. One is by directly
                administering a test and observing the results. If the data
                collected supports the argument, then it proves its validity and
                vice versa. The other way is by giving it up for criticism by
                scientists. If it stands, then it becomes corroborated.

                The hypothetico-deductive theory, despite its effectiveness, has
                its limitations. According to Haig (2018), the approach is too
                lenient. It accepts any positive instance of a hypothesis that
                result from its use. Another criticism it has faced is that it
                presents a single hypothesis for critical evaluation without
                considering its performance alongside related hypotheses (Haig,
                2018). However, even with its limitations, it has maintained its
                popularity among many scientists. Some of its opposers have
                recommended complete abandonment of the theory (Glymour, 1980;
                Rozenboom, 1997). On the contrary, it also has some merits. A
                few optimists feel that modifications are all the theory
                requires to yield acceptable results (Sprenger, 2011). It is a
                simple model that does not require a lot of research.
                Furthermore, it accommodates as many responses as possible in
                support of the hypothesis.

                This study will consider a relationship between two variables:
                “condition of health” and “change in financial situation.” The
                aim is to find out what they have in common. The hypothesis for
                the study is “financial issues and the mental health of an
                individual have a causal relationship.” Even a slight mental
                health problem could have a link to one’s financial health way
                before diagnosis or the cost of treatment. It is, therefore, not
                surprising that the number of entrepreneurs experiencing mental
                illnesses increases every year. Studies have indicated high
                rates of depression, bipolar spectrum disorder and drug abuse
                among entrepreneurs as compared to the general public (Gardner
                et al., 2004; Ghaemi, 2011). There are many reasons behind the
                trend. Sitting to draft a budget is one hectic activity to many
                people and a slight illness may cause some to shy away from it.
                Furthermore, sometimes people tend to mess with their finances
                to boost their self-esteem, especially when trying to cope with
                competition.

                A change in financial situation also impacts the health of an
                individual. The change may either be an improvement or a
                decline, both of which influence one’s wellbeing. A reduction in
                finances has been one of the causes of poor physical and mental
                health over the years. However, there are rare cases of diverse
                health problems resulting from improvements in financial status.
                Looking at physical health, Warth et al. (2019), in their
                journal, associate sleep problems to debts and other financial
                issues. Other common physical health conditions caused by
                deteriorating financial states are migraines, heart diseases,
                and diabetes. A research by Whitehead & Bergeman (2017) found
                that people who are not experiencing a decline in the financial
                situation have minimal chances of suffering from physical health
                deterioration. If not taken care of, the above-mentioned
                conditions can result in more severe diseases that can further
                worsen one's financial state.

                {" "}
                Studies have also indicated that a decline in finances can cause
                psychological problems and poor mental health in general. Mental
                disorders such as depression are familiar to people with
                financial difficulties, especially those with debts (Richardson
                et al., 2013). Mental health and financial health have a
                cyclical relationship. The latter causes the former, which in
                turn worsens the latter and so on. Financial deterioration does
                not always cause mental health problems. Sometimes it is the
                vice versa, and with time the mental health problem leads to
                more financial difficulties. In the end, one’s behavior gets
                affected. For instance, one may start misusing alcohol and other
                drugs. A survey in 2014 by the American Psychological
                Association showed that 33% of Americans reported ingesting
                harmful substances to deal with depression as a result of
                financial difficulties (2020). Furthermore, mental health
                problems affected one’s physical health in the long run.
              </p>
              <p>
                An unfavorable change in the financial situation means one will
                have less money to spend. As a result, some people will opt to
                take shortcuts or forfeit doing some things altogether. Most
                people will choose to sacrifice or delay seeking medical
                attention or keeping medical appointments. In 2018, for
                instance, reports indicated that over 29% of Americans decided
                to hold off seeking medication to save on cost. It may sound
                like a wise way of saving money for something else, but it has
                bigger repercussions. It may end up causing worse health
                problems that will demand a higher cost compared to what one
                should have paid initially (Kraft et al., 2009). Even worse, it
                may result in stress and stress-related disorders.

                McEwen (2010) defines stress as anything that interferes with or
                threatens one’s mental stability and integrity, often leading to
                undesired behavior. At its onset, usually is an expectation or
                an event, for instance, a job interview, a first date, an
                examination, or trouble at work. They will mostly increase cause
                pressure or sudden unforeseen changes. Our familiarity with the
                phenomenon will result in some perceptions or prejudgment due to
                fear, anxiety, or past experience. These will, in turn, cause
                responses within the body that will affect our mental state,
                manifesting physically through behavioral responses. Stress has
                occasionally gotten linked to later physical illnesses after an
                emotional disturbance. A generally accepted reason for it is
                that stress messes with the body's internal state of normalcy or
                homeostasis. This paper will critically analyze the relationship
                between stress and physical illness.

                {" "}
                Stress is a mental problem, whereas physical illnesses are
                problems affecting the body. Since stress directly affects the
                brain, and the brain controls the body, I developed an interest
                in studying the effects of stress on the body. Research has it
                that most people who go through stress or trauma at any point in
                their lives have significant physical health problems (Kumari &
                Mukhopadhyay, 2020). The numbers are big, with approximately 5%
                of the male population and 10% of the female population going
                having the experiences (Kumari & Mukhopadhyay, 2020). However,
                most people do not really understand the processes involved
                between the physical and psychological pathways to create the
                influences.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Stress can result from a past experience or an upcoming event
                that we perceive to be potentially harmful. Past traumatic
                experiences get stored in the unconscious mind, and whenever we
                encounter "triggers," the memories get stirred, and we
                experience stress. Upcoming or presently, ongoing events can
                also be stressful and harmful to our physical health eventually.
                The big question is how it happens.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Any slight occurrence of stress causes the body to react by
                switching into what Kumari & Mukhopadhyay refer to as "survival
                mode." In a better term, the central nervous system goes into
                the sympathetic nervous system, which is more like a panic mode.
                At this state, several hormones get discharged incessantly, and
                each serves a specific function. Some initiate fright and flight
                responses, while others, such as cortisol, increase blood sugar,
                and pressure (Kumari & Mukhopadhyay, 2020). Hence, the
                circulatory system comes under strain, and one easily gets
                heart-related conditions. The worse comes from the hormone
                corticosteroid. This is a stress hormone that, when released,
                reduces the number of white blood cells or lymphocytes. Reducing
                the lymphocytes negatively affects the body’s immunity, thereby
                making it vulnerable to illnesses. That explains why physical
                illnesses often accompany stress and other psychological
                problems.

                {" "}
                Secondly, stress affects the alimentary canal by hindering
                digestion. However, after it passes, digestion accelerates,
                leading to ulcers and other illnesses such as irritable bowel
                syndrome (IBS). Kumari and Mukhopadhyay (2020), in their paper,
                found stress to be among the major causes of gastrointestinal
                problems and complications such as irregular colon contractile
                reactions.

                {" "}
                The physical illnesses are not always a result of direct stress
                effects on the body. Most people attempt to find ways to deal
                with stress that may either be constructive or destructive.
                However, the latter more often than not cause harm to their
                bodies in the process. For instance, most people would prefer to
                take up drinking to help them bear the trauma. Drinking has its
                own health effects, such as liver cirrhosis. Furthermore,
                intoxication can easily make one lose control and engage in
                violence and other illegal activities that equally pose a danger
                to their health. A small group, however, take refuge in eating.
                The consequence of too much eating is another trending health
                problem of obesity. Even though many would argue in favor of
                their stress management techniques being helpful, in the long
                run, they come with other problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The research by Kumari and Mukhopadhyay (2020) is important
                since it gives therapists something new to think about when
                dealing with stress victims. Most of the physical illnesses
                caused by stress and other psychological disorders linger for a
                very long time (Kumari & Mukhopadhyay, 2020). Some even last a
                lifetime and recur after every treatment session. Hence, knowing
                the cause of the problem would be the first step in solving the
                mystery. For instance, if someone went through a sexual assault
                at some point, they would most likely suffer from ulcers.
                Treating their ulcers would be pointless without first knowing
                their cause since the illness will recur every time something
                triggers the memory. However, helping them through the event,
                for instance, through psychotherapy, would not only manage the
                stress; it will also get rid of the ulcers. The research gave me
                something else to think of and perhaps write a paper about. What
                about the vice versa? Does physical illness also increase the
                risk of experiencing stress? There is a possibility.
              </p>

                In conclusion, from the discussion above, it is clear that
                exposure to stress poses a threat to many bodily functions. This
                paper supports the research by Kumari and Mukhopadhyay and their
                conclusion that stress is a threat to public health. I would
                recommend that more research be done on ways of dealing with
                stress and other psychological issues. With this knowledge in
                the public domain, there would be lesser cases of physical
                illnesses resulting from stress and trauma.

                Robert Guthrie, Ph.D., was not the first African-American to
                study psychology beyond the undergraduate level, but he became
                the most popular than his predecessors. He defied all odds to
                earn a master's and later on a Ph.D. in the field despite the
                high rate of racial discrimination at the time. Even though
                racism is still a social ill in today's society, it is nothing
                compared to the mid-20th century when Guthrie schooled. Such was
                the prejudice that even the university educators felt that he
                was out of place, but he pushed on regardless. Guthrie
                eventually left a lasting legacy and opened doors for other
                blacks to venture into the field of psychology. Perhaps the most
                splendid crown to his successful life was the National Archives
                of American Psychology, taking his papers into their deposit.
                The director explained that were it not for his works, blacks'
                schooling conditions in colleges would never have gotten to the
                public domain. This essay will discuss Robert Guthrie's early
                life, achievements, and contributions to the psychology
                discipline.

                Guthrie's birthplace was Chicago, but he got raised in Kentucky
                since his father had to take up a job there. Segregation was the
                order of the day in Kentucky, and as a result, the scope of
                Guthrie's dreams got narrowed. All he ever thought he could be
                in life was a primary public school teacher due to the limited
                opportunities African-Americans had. The only people he could
                associate with were blacks: in the church, neighborhood, and
                school. Regardless of the segregation, Guthrie put effort into
                schooling, where he bumped into psychology, and his adventure
                began.

                After his high school, Robert Guthrie secured a scholarship to
                Florida A&M University, primarily to play the clarinet for the
                school orchestra. Segregation was no lesser at the institution,
                and besides that, he had financial struggles, barely managing a
                meal per day. For the first time during the orientation, he
                encountered psychology and took developed an interest in the
                discipline, eventually pursuing it for his undergraduate. An
                African-American instructor, Professor Joseph Akward, played a
                crucial role in his decision to take psychology. Prof. Akward
                was a retiree from the military, having participated in the
                Second World War. His dedication to the teaching lecturing
                profession attracted Guthrie. He went further to point out the
                racial inequality in the faculty at the time, stirring the
                desire to instill change within Guthrie. However, Guthrie's
                newfound passion became short-lived as he got conscripted into
                the military during the Korean War. Guthrie, however, enjoyed
                his military experience more than he expected; for once in his
                life, he interacted with whites without feeling lesser. He
                complimented the army for having taken giant steps towards
                ending racial discrimination (O'Connor, 2001). After the war, he
                resumed his studies and earned his undergraduate.

                Schooling for Guthrie did not end after his undergraduate level,
                but it became much more comfortable after segregation finally
                got abolished. He took advantage of the abolition to pursue his
                master's in the University of Kentucky, where he was the only
                black in psychology. Even with the removal of the social ill,
                Guthrie still got isolated throughout his course, only managing
                to associate with one white in the entire course. When he
                realized that the discrimination involved even the instructors,
                all he wanted to do was finish schooling and leave. Eventually,
                he finished, and amid a series of teaching and military
                engagements, he earned his Ph.D. from another institution –
                United States International University.

                Guthrie participated in many occupations during and after his
                studies. After attaining his master's, Guthrie returned to the
                military, where he worked in Canada with the Airforce. He did
                well and, after ending his stint there, moved to San Diego with
                his family, where he took up teaching. He taught in high school
                and for a period of time at San Diego Mesa College. He was the
                first-ever African-American professor at the tertiary
                institution, and he made a name there by forming the Association
                of Black Psychologists (“Featured Psychologist: Robert V.
                Guthrie, Ph.D.," 2013). After earning his Ph.D., Guthrie got a
                teaching position at the University of Pittsburg as an associate
                professor, staying there shortly before moving to the National
                Institute of Education in Washington DC. There he became a
                researcher in his field, but again his stay was short-lived. He
                earned many promotions in the various places he worked in,
                whereas most other African-Americans were toiling in search of
                jobs. His determination eventually landed him a job at the
                Office of the Naval Research – psychological sciences division –
                as an associate director (“Featured Psychologist: Robert V.
                Guthrie, Ph.D.," 2013). His last major occupation was at
                Southern Illinois University as an instructor. He tutored
                applied experimental psychology.

                Robert Guthrie made a vast and unforgettable contribution to the
                field of psychology. When he first joined Florida A&M for his
                undergraduate, his biggest mentors were the black professors who
                coached them. However, segregation had made it impossible for
                African-American instructors to get recognized. Therefore,
                Guthrie took it upon himself to be an inspiration to others the
                same way the professors had opened his mind. He even came out of
                retirement to continue lecturing and mentoring more students in
                the 1980s. Furthermore, he decided to bring to light the work
                the black professors did during the segregation period that
                unfortunately had gone unrecognized. He did that by writing a
                book – Even the Rat Was White – that deeply discussed the extent
                of racism in the field. None of his efforts got wasted, for it
                did not take long for the psychology department to embrace
                diversity. Most psychologists later believe that he was
                instrumental in pointing out the inadequacies in the department.
                Nonetheless, his bold statements set a course for an
                all-encompassing system that seems to get better by the day.

                Robert Guthrie published a lot of inspiring and insightful
                works, most of which have gotten archived in the National
                Archive of American Psychology. His most popular work was the
                book Even the Rat was White: A Historical View of Psychology
                that he published in 1976. The book had a divided reception
                courtesy of the discriminative nature of society then. Blacks,
                as expected, received it enthusiastically. The reaction of the
                whites, however, was apathetic as they claimed that he was
                trying to create a conflict between the two races where none
                was. However, the book genuinely pointed out the racism in
                psychology that was evident even in various psychologists'
                works. The works aimed at belittling the efforts of
                African-Americans and promoting opinions about the inferiority
                of the black race. Guthrie went ahead in the book to list early
                black psychologists who made significant contributions to the
                field but whose efforts got overlooked. In later versions of the
                book, he criticized the works that suggested that different
                races had different levels of intelligence and IQ. Another great
                work that he published was the book Being Black,
                Psychological-sociological Dilemmas. He published the book in
                1970, and in it, he attempted to paint a clearer picture of what
                blacks went through. The book appeals to pathos in the way he
                speaks from the blacks' point of view. He explains the mental
                torture they undergo in a country rife with racism.

                Robert Guthrie is certainly a legend in society but especially
                in the African-American community. Fighting to level the
                battlefield of psychology singlehandedly is no mean feat. One
                admirable thing about him is the determination he had that never
                waned despite serious setbacks. Guthrie was a lone black in the
                University of Kentucky while he was pursuing his master's.
                Everyone would stare at him, seemingly questioning his business
                there. He neither got support from his fellow colleagues nor the
                lecturers or the faculty. Nevertheless, he knew his business
                there and did not dwell on trivial matters. Guthrie did not stop
                at empowering himself. He went further to inspire other blacks
                to be open-minded. One of the ways he did that was by founding
                the Association of Black Psychologists in a bid to give blacks a
                voice. The pioneers believed that the whites' psychology did not
                cover the mental state of the African-Americans. The
                organization, therefore, sought to address needs that the then
                white-centered society failed to cover. Nevertheless, it
                actively disputed concepts of African-American inferiority that
                were all over the existent psychology. Finally, Guthrie wrote
                books to emphasize his points further. In my opinion, there is
                no stone he left unturned. Hence, the decision by the National
                Archives of American Psychology to store his papers was the
                right call to make.

                The study of behavior, brain, and cognition has become one of my
                aspirations to answer some questions. For instance, I would want
                to know what makes people remember some names and fail to
                remember others. Another is why one would still manage to follow
                a speech amid other interfering noises. The more I dig into it,
                the more I become even more interested besides developing a
                deeper understanding of the brain's involvement in behavior and
                cognition. Therefore, I aspire not only to gain knowledge but
                also to help special groups in the population.

                The field has a variety of career choices that would utilize the
                knowledge acquired. However, I would like to apply it to a
                clinical setting where I can help patients with mental issues. I
                aim to understand brain dynamics more to be in a pole position
                to understand patients better. Only then can I associate with
                them and address them as humans rather than merely as
                exceptional cases.

                The study of behavior, brain, and cognition makes it possible to
                understand the intimate relationship they have. Most shortfalls
                in behavior and cognition usually result from damage in some
                parts of the brain. For instance, deficits in speech in an
                individual are often a result of damage to a part of the brain
                called Broca’s area. Without this knowledge, many people make
                assumptions and sometimes wrong hypotheses about strange
                behaviors, especially among infants. Psychology hence comes in
                as an additional informer or advisor.

                In summation, my interest in pursuing this topic results from
                the interdisciplinary nature of the field. Apart from being
                pivotal in a clinical setting, it has recently proven its value
                in education and law. Hence, it is a field that will fully use
                my skills in a variety of ways to help special groups in the
                population.
